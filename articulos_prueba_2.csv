1,"Learning ecology requires training in data management and analysis. Because of its transparent and flexible nature. R is increasingly used for data management and analysis in the field of ecology. Consequently. job postings targeting candidates with a bachelor's degree and a required knowledge of R have increased over the past ten years. In this paper. we begin by presenting data from the last ten years demonstrating the increase in the use of R. an open-source programming environment. in ecology and its prevalence as a required skill in job descriptions. We then discuss our experiences teaching undergraduates R in two advanced ecology classes using different approaches. One approach. in a course with a field laboratory. focused on collecting. cleaning. and preparing data for analysis. The other approach. in a course without a field laboratory. focused on analyzing existing datasets and applying the results to content discussed in the lecture portion of the course. Our experiences determined that each approach had strengths and weaknesses. We recommend that above all. instructors of ecology and related subjects should be encouraged to include R in their coursework. Furthermore. instructors should be aware of the following: Learning R is a separate skill from learning statistics, writing R assignments is a significant time commitment for course preparation, and there is a tradeoff between teaching R and teaching content. Determining how one's course fits into the curriculum and identifying resources outside of the classroom for students' continued practice will ensure that R training is successful and will extend beyond a one-semester course.

2,"Nowadays full of information technology. it is important to provide valuable information in teaching or research that can adapt the content of education to the needs of a rapidly developing society. It is our targeted step towards achieving the desired adaptation of educational content to provide such suitable application materials using the Excel. The computing systems guide the development of abilities and the basic factors of students' thinking in learning mathematics. The use of these tools in solving various practical problems truly penetrates all mathematical disciplines and today we are able to solve the most diverse mathematical problems thanks to properly designed program. Nowadays. there are many modern complex environments such as Excel. whose use in selected mathematical applications we want to bring near at least briefly in our article. The Excel software provides us with various implemented functions. commands and programming language enabling implementation of various algorithms. Our work is focused on creating several tasks for the development of logical thinking. Tasks are in the form of application examples using cross-subject relationships. The assignment of tasks is for students of vocational schools of economics. The tasks use the logical function ""IF"" in Excel and focus on the application of knowledge from specialized subjects. To use this function. it is necessary to formulate a logical test that has a clear criterion and exhausts all cases that may occur in decision making. Using Excel also offers the opportunity to expand tasks and then experiment with tasks. The information presented in our article can be used in various mathematical disciplines to solve or automate the solution of a wide range of problems. so that the text can be used by students who are just beginning to use the Excel environment to solve and understand the principle of problems using the implemented functions such as a ""IF"" condition.

3,To combat the difficulty that many students must learn how to program. the failure in introductory programming courses and the traditional high dropout rate. teachers have to use strategies that motivate and improve students' skills. Active methodologies and student-centered instruction can be a solution to get students interested on the subject. preparing assignments while learning in the classroom. This article reports on two very different experiences in two academic years. In the first year. agile SCRUM methodology. groups of five students. three interactions and a final project were used. In the second year. the Project based Learning was used with groups of three students for two different products. changing the composition of the groups. In both cases. peer classification was used. The results show that in the first case there is an increase in the approval rate. while in the second case there is an increase in the dropout rate. In this article we make a critical analysis of the results. analyzing what can be beneficial in one experiment and in the other in order to find an ideal model for using active methodologies to teach freshman computer science students how to program.

4,In the regression analysis the variable to be predict is known as the dependent variable. The variables that are used to make the prognosis are called independent variables. In addition. to predicting the values of the dependent variable. regression analysis allows to identify the type of mathematical relationship that exists between a dependent variable and an independent variable in order to quantify the effect that the changes in the latter have on the former. as well as to identify uncommon observations. The simplest type of regression analysis is in which an independent variable and a dependent variable intervene and in which the relationship between these variables is approximated through a straight line. This type of regression analysis is called simple linear regression.Within this context an e-learning course was developed adapting the subject regression and linear correlation in the subjects of Statistics that are imparted in the degrees of Engineering in the FESC. the purpose of using the e-learning course is (a) to optimize its contribution to the contents. skills and competences that students must have. (b) the integration of statistical software in courses to highlight applications to problems and real contexts of concepts and methods. (c) the development of interactive materials that facilitate their updating and learning by experimentation. (d) the use of a continuous assessment model that guides and prepares students in their training. and (g) The promotion of online collaborative learning through the assignment of projects and activities to be carried out in working groups.We consider that e-learning offers students greater flexibility with respect to the conventional method of class in the classroom since it is not necessary to be present in class to review the subject of regression and linear correlation. but once enrolled in the course. The students can receive it in any time slot. in addition the student can set their own learning rhythms. depending on the time available and the goals set.With the use of this course allows us to implement to students a new concept of the use of modern statistics. which indicates that it is not so important to memorize formulas or perform complex arithmetic calculations by hand. instead you can focus on getting results in a faster way using some kind of technology (software. advanced calculators. specialized websites. etc...) then give practical meaning to the results through critical thinking.

5,Autoscalers exploit cloud-computing elasticity to cope with the dynamic computational demands of scientific workflows. Autoscalers constantly acquire or terminate virtual machines (VMs) on-the-fly to execute workflows minimizing makespan and economic cost. One key problem of workflow autoscaling under budget constraints (i.e. with a maximum limit in cost) is determining the right proportion between: (a) expensive but reliable VMs called on-demand instances. and (b) cheaper but subject-to-failure VMs called spot instances. Spot instances can potentially provide huge parallelism possibilities at low costs but they must be used wisely as they can fail unexpectedly hindering makespan. Given the unpredictability of failures and the inherent performance variability of clouds. designing a policy for assigning the budget for each kind of instance is not a trivial task. For such reason we formalize the described problem as a Markov decision process that allows us learning near-optimal policies from the experience of other baseline policies. Experiments over four well-known scientific workflows. demonstrate that learned policies outperform the baseline policies considering the aggregated relative percentage difference of makespan and execution cost. These promising results encourage the future study of new strategies aiming to find optimal budget policies applied to the execution of workflows in the cloud.

6,"Redundant assignments are a common way to manage team performance. This requirement arises from real-world practices including team management. and highly-available systems. However. it is a complex problem due to limited resources. The lack of available modeling tools makes it even more difficult to provide an accurate solution. Role-Based Collaboration (RBC) and its Environments-Classes. Agents. Roles. Groups. and Objects (E-CARGO) model are tools well suited to tackle such a problem.This paper formalizes the problem of determining the most economical redundant assignment (MERA) with the E-CARGO model. clarifies it as a multi-objective optimization problem, proposes two solutions: one by using a Linear Programming (LP) solver. i.e.. the IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Platform (CPLEX), and one by using our previous work on Group Role Assignment (GRA). where the latter solution is much more efficient than the former one. This work contributes an investigation of the MERA problem to state of the art on the subject of assignment. The proposed solution provides technical support for decision making in solving similar problems. PU  - IEEE PI  - NEW YORK PA  - 345 E 47TH ST. NEW YORK. NY 10017 USA"

8,This study sought out to explore the contributions of the Iranian school organizational climate to English Foreign Language (EFL) teachers' job satisfaction in a mixed methods approach in a broad scope in Iran. To accomplish the objectives. using stratified random sampling. a total of 440 male and female teachers from state schools and private language schools in Tehran. Markazi. and Lorestan Provinces were selected. The quantitative data were gathered by means of a modified version of Horowitz and Zak's (1979) School Organizational Climate Questionnaire and Spector's (1985) Job Satisfaction Questionnaire. The qualitative data were also collected by administering interviews with 40 EFL teachers selected using stratified random sampling. Then. the data were analyzed through Pearson correlation. multiple regression analysis. and content analysis. Results revealed that there exists a significant positive correlation between the school organizational climate and the EFL teachers' job satisfaction. In addition. it was found that the job satisfaction is mostly affected by teaching load. principal leadership. autonomy and decision making. and intimacy and warmth factors. Besides. the findings disclosed that the school organizational climate is neither favorable nor positive such that it has negatively affected the Iranian EFL teachers' job satisfaction. In the end. the pedagogical and managerial implications of the findings are discussed in-depth. PU  - TAYLOR {\&} FRANCIS AS PI  - OSLO PA  - KARL JOHANS GATE 5. NO-0154 OSLO. NORWAY
9,"External funding is required for promotion and tenure in many disciplines. especially at research intensive universities. The purpose of this study was to identify barriers and assets to external funding for African American faculty at a research intensive university. A phenomenological approach was used to capture the voice of 16 African American faculty through focus groups and interviews. Data were interpreted through the lens of Critical Race Theory. The three primary themes were: (1) barriers. (2) influence of race. and (3) assets. Barriers included lack of mentors and collaborators, teaching load and lack of protective time, scarcity of funding, and lack of administrative support and infrastructure for getting grants out. Faculty reported several assets for securing funding. These included both personal (e.g. good training. innovation) and external (e.g. collaborations with community members) assets. Recommendations for addressing barriers are provided. PU  - ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS. TAYLOR {\&} FRANCIS LTD PI  - ABINGDON PA  - 2-4 PARK SQUARE. MILTON PARK. ABINGDON OX14 4RN. OXON. ENGLAND"
10,Modern higher education is actively moving beyond national boundaries and therefore it faces a number of specific problems. One of these problems is an exchange student's adaptation to living in studying conditions of the new country. It is necessary to form an indicator system for adaptation process prognostic and risk reducing models and solve foreign student's adaptation assessment. prediction and management problems in the most effective way. This paper is devoted to the algorithms and software development for monitoring. assessing. forecasting and managing the foreign student's adaptation process (especially in the Russian universities) based on an integrated approach which coordinates a set of methods. including: multivariate statistical and the hierarchical analysis. fuzzy sets and data mining. A foreign student's adaptation abilities assessment criteria and hierarchical risk model's design are based on an integrated risk management approach. The fuzzy set method makes it possible to successfully assess the foreign student's adaptation level in Russian universities for different initial conditions and characteristic sets. Decision priorities were set using a data structure obtained with the hierarchy analysis method. Student's adaptation. development and disruption forecasting are possible as an application of a heterogeneous sequential procedure. An integrated approach to the foreign student's adaptation assessment. prediction and management was implemented to develop a decision support system for foreign student's adaptation process management based on a set of methods and decision rules for the exchange student's individual adaptive assessment and its breakdown prediction.   2018 IEEE
11,predicting students' academic performance in advance is of great importance for parents. management of higher education institutions and the student itself. Selection of a right academic program at right time can save time. efforts and resources of both parents and educational institutions. To achieve this goal. an intelligent decision support system (IDSS) is essential to predict students' performance prior to their admissions in any academic program or getting promoted to the higher classes in an academic program. Scope of this work is to first identify key features. influencing students' performance. and then develop an accurate predication model for prediction of their performance. prior to taking admission in an intended program or deciding to continue for higher classes and semesters in the same program or to quit the program at this stage. In this study. first. a subjective method is used for identification of academic and socio-economic features to develop the prediction model and then a decision tree-based algorithm. Logistic Model Trees (LMT). is adopted to learn the intrinsic relationship between the identified features and students' academic grades. The proposed model is trained and tested on a real-world dataset of 1.021 records. collected from examination database of the University of Peshawar. Simulation of the results is performed in Weka 3.8 environment with its default parameters and 10-folds cross validation setting. The proposed system achieved predictive accuracy of 83.48%.which guides parents. management of higher education institutions and students itself to decide whether they should go forward or quit this program at this stage.   2019 IEEE.

While computer-science lessons emphasize algorithm complexity. technological problems are usually neglected although they may significantly affect the performance in terms of wall time. As the technological problems are best explained by hands-on experience. we present a set of homework assignments focused on a range of technologies from instruction-level parallelism to GPU programming to cluster computing. These assignments are a product of a decade of development and testing on live subjects ? the students of three performance-related software courses at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics of the Charles University in Prague.   2021 Elsevier Inc.
15,Abstract: A new approach to creating a domain-specific heterogeneous distributed computing environment is considered. It is used to support decision-making on urgent problems of increasing the survivability of energy systems. The approach is based on the use of high-performance computing. multiagent scheduling of computations and resource assignment. tools for processing semistructured information. and visualization of subject data using electronic maps. Decision-making alternatives are evaluated using combinatorial modeling and multicriteria optimization. Orlando Tools is used as the base for the environment?s integrated software. It implements flexible modular construction of scalable scientific applications (distributed application packages). The advantages of using the environment are demonstrated by the example of solving practical problems.   2021. Pleiades Publishing. Ltd.
16,Academic misconduct stemming from file-sharing websites is an increasingly prevalent challenge in tertiary education. including information technology and engineering disciplines. Current plagiarism detection methods (e.g. text matching) are largely ineffective for combatting misconduct in programming and mathematics based assessments. For these reasons. the development of an effective. automated monitoring tool would provide significant benefit in the struggle against misconduct. To address this challenge. this paper reports an innovative software tool named AssignmentWatch which supports academic integrity by actively monitoring for the upload of assessment content online. with a focus on file-sharing websites. This monitoring and alert notification system reduces the time burden on educators by automating the detection process. The design of AssignmentWatch focuses on early detection which enables educators to take early action. This could include preventative education. or removal of content before it is utilized by students. Through this. AssignmentWatch can reduce incidents of misconduct. The software tool is open source and made freely available to the community. AssignmentWatch was validated under controlled conditions. followed by field testing in 30 assignments. across 16 subjects and 5 higher education institutions. AssignmentWatch was found to effectively detect uploads on a variety of websites. generally within 24 hours. In field testing. AssignmentWatch received positive feedback from educators with 8 out of 10 educators stating AssignmentWatch aided academic integrity and 7 out of 10 users stating AssignmentWatch helped identify assignment content online.

17,Video conferencing has enabled synchronous communication in a classroom and created multi-sensory content to stimulate learners. Artificial intelligence involves complex equations that are better taught using a constructive pedagogy where students experiment with alternative ways of solving the same problem. Multiple-choice questions have high reliability and can easily reveal student skill levels in a quick way. The Australian Computer Society accreditation exercise ensures that the content for each subject serves as a flexible template for teaching. The geographical extent of the country requires the presence of multiple subordinate campuses affiliated to a main campus. Following the concept of strands. it was also necessary to show continuity in learning and assessments between the first- and second-year subjects. Student feedback for subjects with artificial intelligence-based simulations showed that several students found it difficult to understand lectures and assignments. Hence. to measure student learning. we introduced a Kahoot quiz during the recess of each lecture that students could join through their mobile phones from different campuses. Software project management is challenging for students with vision or attention-related disorders. We taught them how to use charts to visually observe variables and narrow down possible relationships before performing in-depth analysis. One of the main purposes of education is employability. Hence. greater context to real world industry examples was introduced into lectures.   2023 by the authors.

19,Objective There have been only a limited number of studies available on the physical requirements in dance teachers (DT). who are responsible for the training of recreational and/or professional dancers and/or dance students. First results provide indications that a consideration of physical work load (teaching load) of this occupational group is necessary. Methods HR measurements were done on a total of 21 DT (f: n = 18. m: n = 3) aged 48.2 +/- 9.3 years during their lessons in three dance styles: ballet (B). jazz/modern dance (J/MD) and pre-school dance (CD). The HR data were objectified using the spiroergometrically measured maximum HR (HRmax). In addition. the rating of perceived exertion (RPE) was asked directly after the lesson using the Borg scale together with an additional questionnaire. Results Depending on the dance style. the average HR load during the lessons ranged between 56.7{\%} +/- 7.4{\%}) (B) and 63.6{\%} +/- 9.8{\%} (CD) of the individual HRmax. No significant differences could be found between the dance styles for the minimum. medium and maximum teaching loads. The DTs rated the average RPE of the teaching units according to BORG (11.4 +/- 2.1). Correlations between the RPE and the mean and maximum cardiovascular loads (r = 0.376. p = 0.037 and r = 0.441. p = 0.013) could be shown for all dance units and for the mean loads in J/MD (r = 0.558. p = 0.044). Conclusion Most dance units do not represent a load in the sense of a endurance training unit. An increase in aerobic fitness and possible positive effects in the context of injury prevention is not to be expected. In J/MD. the use of RPEs for the rough estimation of cardiovascular stress is conceivable. The assessment of cardiovascular load in dance lessons requires further investigations for more precise assessments. PU  - BMC PI  - LONDON PA  - CAMPUS. 4 CRINAN ST. LONDON N1 9XW. ENGLAND
20,"In 2006. The Impact of Online Teaching on Faculty Load: Computing the Ideal Class Size for Online Courses. shared the results of early research into the ideal class sizes for traditional (i.e.. face-to-face) and online courses based on faculty load.

21,In this paper. we investigate the multi-task federated learning in mobile edge computing (MEC) networks where a central server assigns different federated learning tasks to different MEC servers and select feasible clients to participate in the federated learning training process. The problem is formulated as a joint client selection and task assignment problem to maximize the total utility of all tasks. subject to the trained model quality and total training latency. Since the above-mentioned problem is NP-Hard. it poses challenges to obtain the optimal solution within polynomial time. the problem is transformed into a many-to-one-to-one 3D matching problem. To further reduce the computation while ensuring the matching stability. we first adopt the spectral clustering algorithm to cluster the clients into multiple client clusters. Then we reformulate the problem as a 3-Partite weighted hypergraph total weight maximization problem. Finally. we propose a greedy and local search (GLS) based algorithm to resolve the problem. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm as compared with baseline schemes. PU  - IEEE PI  - NEW YORK PA  - 345 E 47TH ST. NEW YORK. NY 10017 USA

23,The purpose of the present study was to explore the contribution of extracurricular coaching on high school teachers' job satisfaction. Specifically. the study looked at how perceptions of the coaching environment (athlete relationships. colleague relationships and opportunities through coaching) influenced teachers' perceptions of stressors (athlete-related and workload-related) and coaching efficacy. and how this in-turn influenced teachers' job satisfaction. The sample examined 2949 teachers from across Canada who volunteered as high school sport coaches. above and beyond their regular teaching load. The results supported that the data fit the model well (SB(264)2 = 973.36. p{\textless}.001. SRMR=.08. CFI=.91. TLI=.90. RMSEA=.055 CI95 [.052. .059]) and that teachers who reported a positive coaching environment had increased coaching efficacy and decreased perceptions of athlete-related and workload-related stressors. Increased coaching efficacy predicted higher job satisfaction. while increased perceptions of stressors predicted lower job satisfaction. PU  - ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS.

24,Teaching microarchitecture at the undergraduate level is challenging due to two reasons. The first is that in most existing commercial architectures. it is hard if not impossible to separate the digital logic layer from the microarchitecture layer. This is especially true in RISC architectures. Second. such examples take different approaches to the implementation of the microarchitecture layer to the extent that often it is cumbersome to find common concepts to teach students about. apart from overarching and very general concepts. To address these limitations. the fourth edition of Structured Computer Organization by A. S. Tanenbaum introduced an innovative and integrated approach for teaching the subject. This approach was developed from 'scratch'. It consists of a hypothetical hardware that executes Java byte-code and it includes a simulator for this hardware. In this paper. we describe how we fully utilized this approach in our classes. exploiting it to go beyond straightforward applications. Our utilization includes a lab assignment that raises expectations from students from merely understanding the existing implementation to extending it in many different ways. Survey results strongly support the hypothesis that our approach was extremely beneficial to help students grasp microarchitecture concepts in addition to other side-effect gains.   2020 IEEE.
25,Classic Feedback and Control is an undergraduate course that introduces students to concepts and methods for modeling. analysis. and design of single-input-single-output feedback control systems in the Electrical and/or Computer Engineering majors. In addition to using lectures to explain theories and assigning homework assignments for students to practice their modeling and analyses skills. instructors would usually supplement the course by a series of hardware-based experiments and software-based simulation labs so that students can apply the acquired knowledge to physical systems and real-world control problems. Similar to many other institutions. our ECE program offers a Feedback and Control course to junior students in the Electrical Engineering and Electromechanical Engineering majors. This course is a 3-hour lecture. 2-hour lab. as a 4-credit course. Topics discussed include modeling in both the time and the frequency domains. time response. model reduction. stability. steady-state error. root locus. design via root locus. frequency response. and design via frequency response. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic. both students and faculty in our institution were forced to work and study from home in summer 2020. In order to engage students in distance learning. application-oriented and active-learning opportunities were created. A series of exclusively software-based labs and projects were designed to help students gain a better understanding of how the knowledge are useful in real-world situations. Particularly. nine simulation labs and two simulation projects were used in the class of summer 2020. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the designed simulation labs and projects in helping students to grasp and then apply the control concepts and ideas. surveys were conducted in the summer 2020 class to collect students' opinions and feedbacks. Among the 27 participating students. 81.4% of students ?agree? or ?strongly agree? that simulation laboratory exercises increased their interest in the subject. 85.1% of students ?agree? or ?strongly agree? that simulation laboratory exercises helped them better to learn course content. and 77.7% of the students thought simulation laboratory exercises were excellent or very good. We also compared the percentage of students who performed at the A. A-. B+. B. and B- levels with past records (while teaching was in-person). which turned out to be comparable and similar. This indicates the effectiveness of these simulation-based labs & projects. and their contribution in helping to maintain the course standard.   American Society for Engineering Education. 2021
26,Computer simulation and computational methods are effective ways to teach course concepts and explore higher-level themes. but the learning curve associated with using these tools in advanced applications is often steep. This paper presents strategies for using MATLAB and Simulink to teach advanced concepts in a senior-level vibrations elective course. The delivery of learning modules was changed and adapted over six years to increase their effectiveness. Despite little change in assignment content. several key adjustments increased the effectiveness of these tools and improved student attitude about the assignments. Successful strategies discussed focus on assignment weight. assignment resources. and balance between learning vs. using the software. All of these ideas reach beyond the particular course and simulation tools used. The effectiveness of improvement strategies is evaluated by student course feedback. assignment performance. and instructor observation. Advanced topics of the course detailed in this paper include nonlinear systems. iterative solution. multi-degree of freedom systems. and other problems that are too time-consuming to solve analytically. but the strategies for effective use of computational methods are not unique to this field. The paper presents general conclusions with strategies to implement a computer simulation tool like MATLAB/Simulink to teach advanced topics. The learning modules solve difficult problems that would be impossible to solve analytically without advanced graduate level coursework and/or an inappropriately large amount of time. Over six-years of adapting and changing the learning modules. student success on - and perception of - the assignments improved. Use of computational tools broadens course content delivery by covering topics inaccessible through analytical methods in a first course on the subject matter. It also shows students how computer tools can effectively solve larger engineering problems similar to those encountered beyond undergraduate education.

27,Considering the time-averaged behavior of a metro elastic optical network. we develop a joint procedure for resource allocation and traffic shaping to exploit the inherent service diversity among the requests for power-efficient network operation. To support the quality of service diversity. we consider minimum transmission rate. average transmission rate. maximum burst size. and average transmission delay as the adjustable parameters of a general service profile. The work evolves from a stochastic optimization problem. which minimizes the power consumption subject to stability. physical. and service constraints. The optimal solution of the problem is obtained using a complex dynamic programming method. To provide a near-optimal fast-achievable solution. we propose a sequential heuristic with a scalable and causal software implementation. according to the basic Lyapunov iterations of an integer linear program. The heuristic method has a negligible optimality gap and a considerably shorter runtime compared to the optimal dynamic programming. and reduces the consumed power by 72{\%} for an offered traffic with a unit variation coefficient.

28,According to literature. networking plays an important role when it comes to reinforce the student performance. In this paper we try to deepen in this concept. presenting data gathered within the period 2014-2018. coming from a single Human Resources subject. belonging to Tourism Faculty. Thus. data from 994 students was registered. using their final grade as the explained variable. Independent variables were students' partial grades and whether they co-authored works or assignments through their assessment. using this for building a network model in software Gephi 0.9.2. Right after this. we could execute a statistical study and calculate for any given student their measures according to the place he or she was keeping within the network. Students who co-authored more assignments received a higher score in centrality. for instance. We also calculated their respective degree. betweenness. closeness. eccentricity. clustering coefficient. etc. Furthermore. apart from the academic performance variables. we also included in our study dummy variables. such as the language of teaching. or the group they belonged. With this we could calculate a model that suggested that not the group nor the language was relevant for predicting the final score got by the student. since no effect seemed to have on the final grades. On the other hand. their final score appeared significantly linked with four statistical measures associated with their networking behaviour (measured through the papers and assignments co-authored). Namely. these variables were eccentricity and eigencentrality (positive relationship). or degree and clustering (negative relationship). From our perspective. and according to our results. networking cannot be understood as a tool plainly useful in any way. for it needs to be qualified. The student could need to overcome several drawbacks even in the event they freely choose their networking team (e.g. lack of time. disparity of mates. disagreements with other members of the network. disengagement. etc). Turns out that the limitations of this study. like the short period available for analysis. or the need for including information from other fields and courses. also constrains the chances of applying it in a wider context. The study is part of a wider project which intends to improve the understanding of the student's behaviour when it comes to organise their work on their own. the responsibilities they take. and even how they tackle their job search strategy.

29,In this paper. downlink joint user association. codebook assignment and power allocation for a Sparse Code Multiple Access (SCMA)-based in Cloud Radio Access Network (C-RAN) are investigated. The main aim of this paper is to accomplish a resource allocation to achieve the maximum total sum rate subject to SCMA limitation. total available power in Radio Remote Head (RRH). fronthaul constraint. users association. user power constraint. and Quality of Service requirements for each user with low complexity. To solve the recommended problem an iterative algorithm considering Successive Convex Approximation is utilized. The main problem is separated into two subproblems of joint user association and codebook assignment and power allocation. By defining a new binary variable for user association and codebook assignment and a new constraint for the user association. the joint user association and codebook assignment subproblem becomes an Integer Linear Programming. Then user association and codebook assignment subproblem solved with the help of the CVX toolbox and MOSEK solver. Furthermore. to solve the power allocation subproblem. Successive Convex Approximation with Low Complexity is applied. Then the power allocation subproblem solved by subgradient method for the Lagrange dual problem. In the simulation results. the effectiveness of the recommended optimization algorithm and resource allocation method are shown and compared to Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access and Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access.

30,Improving the intelligence of teaching environment and making the multimedia teaching equipment has become a major concern of the colleges and universities. To this end. the design of Internet of Things (IoT) technology based wisdom of higher education platform is of great interest. Designing the structure of online management platform for college education and realizing the functions of examination result inquiry. online teaching. and attendance management have gained more importance in the educational research. The wisdom classroom is the key structure of the wisdom education platform. A smart classroom architecture based on IoT technology is designed. which connects with traditional network facilities through the IoT gateway. Different layers of the architectures have been designed and implemented. The proposed platform tests results and shows that the intelligent education platform can effectively control classroom utilization and has high throughput. low application latency. and good practicability.   2021 Jinhua Liu et al.
31,Educational leadership is essential to implement information and communications technologies in schools but the leadership practice of information and communications technologies coordinators. a position role that supports teachers to implement information and communications technologies. appears limited. The present study applies a distributed perspective to leadership and investigates aspects of information and communications technologies coordinator context that would facilitate leadership. Twenty-seven information and communications technologies coordinators were surveyed on their schools? structures and mechanisms that mediate their leadership practice. Descriptive statistics show that a wide range of structures and mechanisms in different quantities and with different qualities can be available to coordinators. The majority of coordinators have neither additional position roles nor a teaching load. but the coordinators have organizational unit assignments and attend daily. routine interactions. A case study illustrates how specific structures and mechanisms would facilitate leadership for information and communications technologies implementation. It is recommended to design an information and communications technologies coordinator role as a formal position role. for a school to employ more than one information and communications technologies coordinator. and to develop an information and communications technologies coordinator?s teaching load. organizational unit assignments and routine interactions according to school needs. Several possible populations of information and communications technologies coordinators are identified for further research.   The Author(s) 2020.
32,"Based on our editorial experience. and acknowledging the regular editor grievances about reviewer disengagement at professional meeting and conferences. in this article we argue that the review system is in need of significant repair. We argue that this has emerged because an audit culture in academia and individual incentives (like reduced teaching loads or publication bonuses) have eroded the willingness of individuals to engage in the collective enterprise of peer-reviewing each others? work on a quid pro quo basis. In response to this. we emphasise why it is unethical for potential reviewers to disengage from the review process. and outline the implications for our profession if colleagues publish more than they review. Designed as a political intervention in response to reviewer disengagement. we aim to ?politicise? the review process and its consequences for the sustainability of the scholarly community. We propose three pathways towards greater reviewer engagement: (i) senior scholars setting the right kind of ?reviewer? example, (ii) journals introducing recognition awards to foster a healthy reviewer progression path and (iii) universities and accreditation bodies moving to explicitly recognise reviewing in workload models and evaluations. While all three proposals have merit. the latter point is especially powerful in fostering reviewer engagement as it aligns individual and institutional goals in ?measurable? ways. In this way. ironically. the audit culture can be subverted to address the imbalance between individual and collective goals.   The Author(s) 2021."
33,Although China's power grid construction is at the forefront of the world. due to the high degree of village dispersion and rugged terrain. some mountainous regions in southwestern China have not so far been connected to the state grid. A group of students in Tsinghua University founded a charitable project called 'Dream Grid' in 2014. aiming at building power systems that meet basic electricity demand of schools in remote areas. The project has been running for 4 years so far. attracting more than 80 students to participate in. More than 150.000 dollars has been raised by sponsorships and crowdfunding to support the construction of 60kW photovoltaic micro grids in 5 different areas. This paper takes one of these projects in Zamthang. Sichuan Province. China. as an example. and explores the design process of a hybrid solar-hydro microgrid for a rural primary school isolated from the national grid. Zongke Village Primary School. the electricity of which is usually supplied by small-capacity hydropower. is one of the largest village school in Zamthang County and has more than 100 students. However. the small capacity and lack of stability of hydropower makes it difficult to solve the electricity supply problem there. The power system design hopes to meet the basic daily teaching loads mainly with a solar system and the lighting demands at night by introducing a battery storage system. The original hydropower and one additional gasoline generator are considered as backup power when PV output is low and energy storage system cannot cover all loads. The size of solar panel and battery storage system is based on the load and insolation analysis. The power system operation is controlled by an energy storage bidirectional converter. which could dynamically adjust the energy distribution based on solar outputs and load power. The design plan which is composed of 10.5kW solar panels. 39kWh battery bank. 5kW gasoline generator and 20kW converter. is actually applied to the project in Zongke. and the entire system has been running for 12 months and produced more than 13MWh electricity so far. Economic analysis is also carried out in this paper. which shows that PV panels. batteries and converter makes up the most of total costs. and the system would yield a cost of 0.296/kWh over the 10-year lifespan. In addition. by providing electricity for the lighting of neighboring households at night and charging an appropriate fee. the cost of power generation at the school can be further reduced by approximately 0.042/kWh.   2018 IEEE.
34,Despite growing promotion of student-centered teaching. few studies have assessed how widely these practices have diffused throughout computer science (CS) higher education. Studies on teaching practices often treat instructor- and student-centered learning as being dichotomous. Recent research indicates that this reductionist model misinterprets what actually goes on in CS classrooms. For example. a recent study found that most CS faculty categorized their teaching practices as equally student-centered and instructor-centered. We contribute to this scholarship by reporting the results of a survey disseminated to 821 CS educators in 595 universities. colleges. and community colleges in the U.S. Participants were asked to report how frequently they employed several instructor- or student-centered teaching practices and tools during the most recent semester that they taught a specific course. Results indicate that when asked to reflect on specific behaviors within a certain timeframe. faculty reported using instructor-centered teaching practices. especially delivering content via lecture. more than student-centered practices. However. most faculty also reported using at least one student-centered technique. albeit less frequently. throughout the semester. This study found few differences across certain situational and demographic variables (e.g.. institution type. tenure status. etc.). Faculty justify their teaching choices with concern for negative evaluations. desire for student learning. large enrollments. heavy teaching loads. and retaining underrepresented students.   2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).
35,A good university experience can help motivate and retain students and faculty. Universities place a strong focus on the student population to reduce attrition levels. Models of attrition and their applications are becoming important and useful given the greater amounts of data available to institutions. Yet. these data focus on transactional events rather than the learning journey. In contrast. there seems to be less emphasis on faculty attrition. and data surrounding this phenomenon is lacking. Here. I argue that teaching and data associated with teaching can help promote retention of both students and academics. To capture the effects of teaching (positive or negative) on faculty. we need better data to understand the dynamics behind teaching load and delivery. I provide a model that can help initiate hypothesis testing and data gathering. This model focuses on minimal amounts of data to understand cohorts (student and academic) at different stages of their journey. I provide a framework to produce positive feedback loops that would benefit learners and scholars alike.   2020. Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.
36,This paper examines why graphic design has struggled to establish an academic research culture. despite significant gains in design research over the last 20 years. It considers the criticisms levelled against graphic design research submitted to the 2014 UK Research Excellence Framework (REF2014). Through analysis of publicly available data. we identify a low volume of graphic design research adhering to traditional academic. non-practice-based forms. and concentrated amongst few institutions. Results confirm graphic design is yet to establish an academic research culture that accords with its widespread standing in higher education (HE). We identify the absence of consensual nomenclature. lack of confidence and exemplars with practice-based graphic design research. the uncertain expectations of research audits. lack of venues for dissemination. heavy teaching loads and few established career pathways for research. In response we make a series of recommendations towards a sustainable graphic design research change agenda.   2019.   2019 Informa UK Limited. trading as Taylor & Francis Group.
37,Full-time non-tenure track faculty. commonly referred to as NTT faculty. are increasingly utilized in higher education and shoulder much of the teaching load within academic institutions. Self-determination theory (SDT) has shown promise as a conceptual frame for characterizing the relationship between environmental support factors and NTT faculty satisfaction. Full-time NTT faculty were sampled nationwide (N = 3.527) to investigate an SDT-based model positing basic psychological needs (i.e.. volitional autonomy and relatedness) as mediators between six environmental support indices and NTT faculty satisfaction (i.e.. teaching/service and global satisfaction). Structural equation model results showed volitional autonomy and relatedness fully mediated the relationships between the six environmental supports and both indices of faculty satisfaction. Results highlight the utility of basic psychological needs in understanding the relationships between the environment and NTT faculty satisfaction. Implications. future directions. and limitations are also presented.   The Author(s) 2019.
38,The purpose of this case study was to investigate the effectiveness of using Grammarly in EFL writing during a 16-week experimental period at a four-year university in China. A total of 43 English-major sophomores participated in this study. Students' writing performance and their perceptions of using Grammarly. were examined through pre-test. post-test. and a questionnaire. The results revealed that students' writing performance significantly increased throughout the 16 week intervention and the students were satisfied with the AI-based writing evaluation program as determined through written feedback. This suggests that applying Grammarly in writing classes is an effective approach for EFL students in developing writing skills and help teachers reduce teaching load.   2020 ACM.
39,This study explored the prioritization of English-medium instruction (EMI) teachers? needs for faculty development and institutional support by applying a best?worst scaling approach to an EMI program in Japan. This prioritization is important as EMI programs need management under various constraints (e.g.. time. budget. and teachers). This study also investigated how teachers? needs for institutional support differ by English language competence and EMI teaching experience and their relationship with EMI programs (e.g.. full-time or adjunct). Questionnaire surveys administered to 38 EMI teachers revealed that. overall. faculty development (FD) program menus training teaching styles. speaking skills. communication skills. and respecting the diversity of students should be prioritized such that it varies depending on the teachers? English language competence levels but not their teaching experience. Irrespective of their relationship with EMI programs. the recognition and appreciation of their burdens. efforts. and contributions is most needed. There are noticeable differences based on their position over the necessity of pedagogical guidelines. teaching load. and economic incentive.   2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI. Basel.

40,Undergraduate research has been shown to enrich education. increase retention and promote critical thinking. Research projects involving extending an already mature and relatively large code base have special value for students. as they mimic industry experience. Students have to understand the existing code structure and figure out where to add their code to extend the functionality of the system. There are obvious challenges for undergraduate students to take on such projects. including lack of knowledge at the onset of the project. limited time span (normally a semester). and limited time availability during a semester. Undergraduate institutions have additional challenges. such as high teaching load for faculty advisors and lack of graduate students who could act as mentors. In this paper. we report our experience with a relatively large project that lasted for several semesters and involved several teams of students. We managed the challenges by being flexible and carving out many mini-projects from this umbrella project. which required that the faculty advisor work closely with students. The project has successfully produced a teaching/learning tool for auto-gradable full tracing exercises. The tool has been prototyped in classrooms and helped students learn various programming constructs. We hope that our experience could encourage larger scale projects in undergraduate institutions.   2021 ACM.
41,The purpose of the study was to analyze the practice of transforming the competence model of scientific and pedagogical workers in the context of digitalization. The study is based on the application of the method of theoretical generalization. The need to develop practices for applying the competence model for further interuniversity exchange of experience determines the relevance of the study. The competence-based approach in the educational system of the Russian Federation has been actively introduced relatively recently. The classical education system aimed at transferring a certain set of knowledge. formed in accordance with the request of state bodies and built into a strict system. from teacher to student. Additional requirements are imposed on the qualifications of a teacher. implying the need to demonstrate competence not only in their professional field. but also in the field of IT technologies. independently organize their workplace and be responsible for the quality of the educational services provided. regardless of their housing and technical conditions. Application of the competence-based approach has actualized the active introduction of a mixed form of education. which involves the use of distance learning elements in the implementation of educational programs. The period from March 2020. associated with forced self-isolation in order to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. has accelerated this process and gave it a new quality. The results of this study indicate that in modern conditions it is necessary to take into account the ability of teachers to carry out high-quality educational activities in a blended learning model when planning the teaching load for the new academic year and admitting teachers to competitive selection. The study allowed us to generalize the specific problems of application of the competence-based approach in the context of digital transformation.   2021 ACM.
42,Research productivity is seen as a shared issue present in most academic institutions. as research output requires skills. time and patience. In the Philippines. higher education institutions are mandated to undertake research and other similar investigations in various academic areas since they are one of the key institutions who play major role in the generation and dissemination of knowledge. This study generally aimed to come up with prediction model for faculty research productivity. Specifically. it tried to seek solutions to the following: identification of necessary attributes that have significant relationship to faculty research productivity. generate computational model for predicting research productivity of faculty through J48 Decision Tree Algorithm and validate the performance of computational model using confusion matrix analysis. precision. recall and f-measure. Results showed that attributes such as paper proposal. length of service. age. teaching loads. academic ranks. designation/s. civil status. academic qualification. sex and status of appointment has vital influence to research productivity of faculty. The computational model generated had an acceptable computed accuracy. precision. recall and f-measure results. Based on the data model performance results. the system can be used and can be implemented in an actual working system.   2021 ACM.
43,"Today's young people use the Internet for their homework. requiring them to apply reliability criteria. This is the subject of this research. which uses an innovative interviewing technique with 9 to 12-year old children. The assignment was to solve a problem about the discrepancy in information about the mummification process in Ancient Egypt. The children were interviewed in pairs within the school environment, they had access to an internet-enabled computer and could search freely for 45 to 60 minutes. Camtasia software recorded every movement on the screen and all verbalized communication. We analyzed four dominant reliability criteria. detailing the search procedures and exchanges between the children. Two criteria show that. from the age of nine. children can focus on relevant aspects of internet sites or make inferences on the list of results generated by search engines. indicating strong intellectual activity and not the ""copy/paste"" method of concern to teachers.

44,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to develop a method to support the definition of efficient and fair divisional projects in particularly complex cases concerning inheritance disputes. Design/methodology/approach: First. the approach involves an appraisal of the market value of the assets. along with an analysis of the respective conditions of concrete divisibility, then. two mathematical models have been developed for the assignment of the assets to the subjects involved in the divisional projects. The logic underlying of both models has been translated into mathematical algorithms that allow for the minimization of the monetary compensations resulting from the differences between the legal right shares and the actual portions to be attributed to them. Findings: Both models have been developed through mathematical formulas that can be easily implemented by using an appropriate calculation software. They can be used in particularly complex inheritance divisions. in which the deceased?s assets are numerous and there are several heirs with similar or different legal right shares. Originality/value: The methodology is useful in the disputes that could arise in hereditary successions. The fundamental value is that the models could support the definition of the best solution in particularly complex situations. characterized by a large number of assets to be assigned and/or the existence of ?preferential? constraints for the assignment of the assets.   2018.

46,The European Astro Pi Challenge is an annual computer coding-based educational programme developed by the European Space Agency (ESA) Education Office. in collaboration with the Raspberry Pi Foundation (RPF). The primary objective of the challenge is to enrich the competencies and skills of pupils across Europe in Science. Technology. Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) subjects. and so. motivate them towards further study and careers in these fields. This paper outlines the technical development of the Astro Pi payload and reviews the 2015 to 2017 educational ground-programmes. Two augmented Raspberry Pi Model B+ computers. called Astro Pi's. equipped with a suite of peripheral sensors and cameras were uploaded to the ISS in 2015. Upgrades to the Astro Pi software were made in 2016. allowing the Pi's to be connected to the ISS Joint Station LAN (JSL) network. and thus. operated directly from ground. thereby minimizing required crew-time support. while maximizing autonomous capabilities. The challenge evolved out of the 'Astro Pi Competition'. created in conjunction with the UK Space Agency for Timothy Peake's Principia mission to the ISS. Two competitions were organised from December 2014 to July 2015. aimed at primary and secondary school age groups. respectively. across the UK. The winning teams in both categories had their computer codes executed on the ISS. The European Astro Pi Challenge 2016/17. linked to the educational programme around the Proxima mission. expanded educational learning objectives and aimed to increase pupil engagement across Europe. Pupil teams were tasked to design a scientific experiment related to living in the ISS and to write the computer code needed to run their experiment. using one of the two on-board Astro Pi computers. In support of the programme. dedicated training resources were produced. online and hands-on training courses for teachers were held. and 600 Astro Pi kits were produced and distributed to participating teams. Demographics showed 295 teams participating. with 184 teams from 15 ESA Member States passing the final selection and submitting their scientific missions and computer codes for the challenge. Following the success of the first instalment. the European Astro Pi Challenge continues with a 2017/18 cycle. Thematic mission assignments have been designed for the participating teams and are used to guide pupils' learning and experimentation process. based on the model of real-life science investigation practices. The recent launch of an online emulator. with supporting classroom resources. has allowed greater accessibility to the programme for pupils and teachers throughout Europe.   2018 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

47,"The volume of data in terms of library resources is big and continuously increasing. therefore manipulation. searching. and suggesting these resources to user have become very difficult. The automation in libraries along with intelligence can solve the problem by easy and correct recommendation system. The intelligence can be incorporated into the system by implementing agent-based recommender system for libraries. An efficient intelligent agent-based library recommender system is developed to generate suggestions to end user by understanding his/her interest automatically by learning his/her profile. The manual recommendation process includes understanding the need of the user. solutions available, decision has to be made about which solution(s) can satisfy the user's need and finally provide the solution(s) by filtering. The needs of user and available solutions are adaptive. It is clear that recommendation process involves the task of decision making and performing action based upon perception of recommender. The term software agent can be referred as a self-contained program capable of controlling its own decision making and acting. based on its perception of its environment. in pursuit of one or more objectives (Jennings and Wooldridge in IEE Rev 42(1):17-20. [1]). Therefore the framework of recommender system is designed using intelligent agent. The framework consists of agent. viz. profile agent. content-based agent. and collaborative agent. Profile agent automatically extracts the input from profile of user. Users may also have tried to search some resources. The search query and the results of the search are used by profile agent while collecting more information about active user. The task of identification of subject area(s) of active user is performed by profile agent. Then profile agent updates the user profile. Content-based agent and collaborative agent perform the main tasks of filtering and providing recommendations. In general. the perfect simulation of the natural recommendation process that human being performs to recommend to someone can provide better results. In this scenario. the main problem to the researchers is to think about the framework which can provide such perfect simulation. The main objective of the proposed architecture is to develop an agent-based recommender system for providing effective and intelligent use of library resources such as finding right book(s). relevant research journal papers and articles. The various issues with the dataset and library recommender system are identified. There are many recommendation domain and applications where content and metadata play a key role can be seen in the literature. In domains such as movies. the relationship between content and usage data has seen thorough investigation done already but for many other domains such as books. news. scientific articles. and Web pages. it is not still known if and how these data sources should be combined to provide the best recommendation performance. This has motivated to develop recommender system using library domain specifically. Some of the datasets such as Book-Crossing dataset. Techlens + dataset. ACL anthology reference corpus (Bird in The ACL anthology reference corpus: a reference dataset for bibliographic research in computational linguistics [2]. Torres et al. in Proceedings of the 4th ACM/IEEE-CS joint conference on digital libraries. pp. 228-236 [3]. Ziegler in current trends in database technology-EDBT 2004 workshops [4]) are available. They are not very useful since only the use of title of the book is not sufficient to improve the performance (Ziegler in current trends in database technology-EDBT 2004 workshops. pp. 78-89 [4]). not made publically available (Torres et al. in Proceedings of the 4th ACM/IEEE-CS joint conference on digital libraries. pp. 228-236 [3]). limited domain (NLP only) (Bird in The ACL anthology reference corpus: a reference dataset for bibliographic research in computation"
48,In this work. we described project-based multi-objective sequential learning modules and the teaching strategy of the machine design subject for undergraduate mechatronics engineering students. The suggested approach introduced the design procedures and concepts using a single multi-level design problem as a semester-long project. The students worked in teams to complete design modifications using new and enhanced design concepts and tools during the semester. An Excel spreadsheet for the design analysis was created by each team and was upgraded repetitively during the course to achieve new design specifications and criteria. In addition. the students built a numerical model for the same project using Finite Elements method and gradually updated the model during the semester using evaluation tools and design libraries in SolidWorks. The students compared and discussed results of the numerical simulation and the traditional design equations and formulas through two midterm projects. final project reports. and several classwork assignments. The Machine Design course had been implemented and evaluated at Engineering Department at Colorado State University - Pueblo. The students' participation rate was high during the implementation of this advanced subject in mechanical engineering. They gained skills in critical thinking. teamwork. and engineering design. The main challenge from the students' perspective was their variable skill level in using the software and from the instructor's perspective was keeping the students involved in a long-term project problem as well as introducing new theoretical concepts in a single design problem. This paper describes learning modules and provides information on how the modules are integrated into a cohesive system at the end of the project.   American Society for Engineering Education. 2018.
49,Security bugs are commonly emerged bugs during the software development and maintenance. which cause security risks during software deployment. Security bugs need to be fixed with high quality and patched faster than other types of bugs. Recommending developers to fix security bugs is one of the important tasks during the security bug fixing process. Some developer recommendation techniques have been proposed to fix the bugs. but most of these techniques did not recommend developers considering their security experience and bug fixing quality. In this paper. an approach. SecDR (security developer recommendation). is proposed to recommend developers by considering the historical data on the quality and complexity of their security bug fixes. In addition. SecDR recommends junior developers for simple bugs. and recommends senior developers for complex bugs. An empirical study on three open source subjects (Mozilla. Libgdx and ElasticSearch) are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of SecDR. In this study. SecDR is also compared with the state-of-art developer recommendation technique. DR_PSF. to evaluate the effectiveness of developer recommendation. Results show that the accuracy of SecDR is improved over DR_PSF with gain values ranging from 19% to 42%. Moreover. the results of SecDR is also compared with actual developer allocation. and results show that SecDR can effectively recommend developers. which is even better than the developer allocation in the real bug assignment environment.

50,This chapter presents a heuristic for a multi-objective ranking problem using a dataset of international interest as an example of its application. namely. the ranking of the world's top educational institutions. The problem of ranking academic institutions is a subject of keen interest for administrators. consumers. and research policy makers. From a mathematical perspective. the proposed heuristic addresses the need for more transparent models and associated methods related to the problem of identifying sound relative rankings of objects with multiple attributes. The low complexity of the method allows software implementations that scale well for thousands of objects as well as permitting reasonable visualization. It is shown that a simple and multi-objective-aware ranking system can easily be implemented. which naturally leads to intuitive research policies resulting from varying scenarios presented within. The only assumption that this method relies on is the ability to sort the candidate objects according to each given attribute. Thus the attributes could be numerical or ordinal in nature. This helps to avoid the selection of an ad hoc single score based on an arbitrary assignment of attributes' weights as other heuristics do. To illustrate the use of this proposed methodology. results are presented and obtained using the dataset on the ranking of world universities (of the years 2007- 2012). by academic performance. published annually by ARWU.

51,First year undergraduate design students have found difficulties in realising the standards expected for academic writing at university level. An assessment initiative was used to engage students with criteria and standards for a core interdisciplinary design subject notable for its demanding assessment of academic writing. The same graduate attribute categories linked to assessment criteria and web-based software (REVIEW?) were used for assessing students? other design assignments. Students engaged with criterion-referenced assessment of an essay exemplar in order to reflect on their own essay writing process. Tutor marking of the exemplar and student essays used a visual mark on a grading scale to reveal the variation between the tutor?s marks and students? own judgments against each criterion. Data from the software and post-semester focus group discussions and questionnaires showed that the initiative promoted engagement and dialogue between tutors and students and fostered independence and confidence. Results suggest that students? understanding of the required academic writing standards was improved by this reflective intervention and increased their appreciation that writing and research skills are important attributes for designers.   2017.

52,Future optical networks. in particular Software Defined Optical Networks (SDONs). are expected to provide reconfigurable services while maintaining an efficient usage of wavelength resources. In this paper. we propose a Make-Before-Break (MBB) wavelength defragmentation process which minimizes the bandwidth requirement of the resulting provisioning. We next compare the latter provisioning with a minimum bandwidth provisioning that is not subject to MBB.The resulting solution process is thoroughly tested on various data and network instances. Numerical experiments show that. on average. the best seamless lightpath rerouting is never more than 5% away (less than 1% on average) from an optimal lightpath provisioning.   2018 IEEE.
53,In this study. teachers are giving an opportunity to design and develop their own educational games. The following three questions guide the research: (1) What are the characteristics of teacher designed and developed games? (2) What theories do teachers use when they make games for educational purposes? (3) What are the design considerations when teachers engage in game authoring experiences? Framed in a qualitative. naturalistic case study perspective. this paper explores 83 teachers? experience and thinking grounded in enactivism. Participating teachers are enrolled in a graduate course focusing on game based learning. Data sources include: teacher written assignments. teacher created digital artifacts. instructor?s reflective journal. and learner feedback after class.

54,Project-based Learning (PBL) is one of the most heard buzzwords within academic discourses in the last decade. It represents a shift in the way the study of engineering is conducted in undergraduate and even graduate programs. However. despite its popularity. the application of PBL is specific to each engineering area and subject. In this paper. we present our experience in applying PBL to two subjects of computer science: Software Engineering and Distributed Systems. We describe how we use online platforms to implement PBL principles and discuss the impact of our approach on the learning performance of students. The automation of work assignments along with the adoption of an Agile methodology from the software industry for collaboration between students. allowed us to implement a continuous evaluation framework that promotes the motivation and the continuous work of students.   2018 IEEE.

56,This paper describes the configuration management process using classified Computer Code. Hardware can confirm the configuration visually. but it is not only difficult for the software to show its integrity or errors. but also hard for developers or user to determine the overall configuration. Due to the properties of the software. it is essential for the entire configuration to be identified and to verify the quality requirement management. Therefore. for the software being developed to be used. configuration management must be handled at the highest level and each software component requires configuration control at its lower level. Computer codes are package software that is used as a tool for design. development. and licensing in the nuclear industry. In general. computer codes are divided into computer design codes. computer analysis codes. and regulatory computer codes. Software includes computer code. which is embedded software that is mounted as part of the hardware system. and supported software being used for additional computer code. The newly developed computer code must be subject to management. analysis. development. coding. testing. installation. operation and maintenance. and retirement phase according to the quality assurance requirements. In this paper. the kind of computer code describes its assignment in the developing of the computer code process and changing of the computer code process. According to the classification. codes were divided into three categories of SW Life Cycle. Combined Cycle. and Simplified Cycle. Depending on the classification. we have three different tick issue classes among the software life cycle. We propose a method of configuration management to manage the quality data of computer codes in a comprehensive manner in an interface.   2018 Westinghouse Electric Company LLC All Rights Reserved
57,"Traditional passive teaching style lacks teacher-student interaction. is not conducive to the improvement of comprehensive quality and the idea of ""To Teach Is to Learn"". This paper takes a subject. construction cost management. of a university in south China as an example. introduces active teaching. combines a variety of teaching methods to reform existing teaching mode. and analyzes the effect of this reform. It is turned out that the teaching model after reform not only sparks students' self-study ability and improves their learning efficiency. but also realizes the two-way interaction between teaching and learning and improves students' comprehensive quality. Moreover. it fosters students' ability to analyze and solve practical problems of construction cost management independently. Besides. this paper puts forward the following suggestion for further improvement of reformed teaching model according to students' opinions: first. enhance the interestingness of the course, second. increase the amount of valid homework assignment after class, third. increase the opportunity of learning cost management software, fourth. carry out detailed guidance on big assignment, fifth. increase the amount of after-class homework tutoring.   2019 American Society of Civil Engineers."
58,BACKGROUND: Due to complex anatomical structure and stress of hip. traditional X-ray and CT scanning have some limitations In the diagnosis of hip. OBJECTIVE: To find an accurate and fast reconstruction method for the entity model of biological skeleton based on CT Image. and to study the stress of the human hip bone. and to establish the optimized hip joint model before operation for three-dimensional printing.

59,Linear Programming (LP) is a well-known. powerful method to solve many problems in industrial and scientific applications. The objective of the present study is to propose the resolution of user LP problems by cloud computing. i.e.. without the usual installation of computer programs for the purpose. We also compare our resolution with other peers? approaches and on-line solvers. typical problems being addressed (transportation. transshipment. assignment. scheduling) applicable in numerous activities. including the pharmaceutical Supply Chains (SC). Thus. instead of providing software for the user to download and install. we offer a website where the user can insert his problems? data and obtain their solutions. Some websites propose comparable solutions. but in little practical ways. The proposed style of action provides a practical and quick access to the advantages of cloud computing. which will encourage users and practitioners from pharmaceutical SC and many other related areas to delve further into the subject.   2019.

60,The repair of software faults is an important task of software engineering. In this paper. an automated repair framework. called TailorFix is designed and implemented based on abstract syntax tree and repair operators. which is easily expandable by adding different types of repair operators. The TailorFix can be combined with a variety of fault localization technologies. In this paper. we integrate the Delta Debugging technique. as an example. into TailorFix. to achieve a fully automated fault localization and repair for assignment statements of C programs. By classifying faults of assignment statements and designing nine kinds of repair operators. a repair method that applies mutation technology to abstract syntax tree is proposed based on the location information of the Delta Debugging. Finally. experimental subjects of SIR (Software-artifact Infrastructure Repository) are used to verify the effectiveness of the TailorFix. With TailorFix. the average rate is high (on average 85.67%for various types of faults) for assignment statements. The proposed TailorFix framework can achieves more accurate repairs using the corresponding repair operators with respect to abstract syntax tree of different grammar structures. and does not require manual repair patterns. specifications. constraint solving. or search space.   2018 IEEE.
61,"Meta-analyses on the effect of peer tutoring have rarely examined the effect of peer tutoring on tutors? academic gain. Some previous analyses are dated and have methodological or theoretical limitations. Hence. there is a compelling need to fill this gap by conducting an updated and comprehensive meta-analysis for identifying certain determinants of best practices for peer tutoring on tutors? academic achievement in the present study. Additionally. role theory and equity theory in peer tutoring were tested. The present meta-analytic study examined 16 articles using The comprehensive meta-analysis software programme and SPSS macro for analyses. It was found that the weighted mean effect size was 0.43 (p < 0.001). Moreover. the crucial parameters for optimizing the effectiveness of peer tutoring interventions are identified as follows: Tutees with low academic ability, tutors coming from secondary school, fewer tutor training sessions per week, shorter tutor training time per session, choosing mathematics as subject content, random assignment of tutees and tutors, structured peer tutoring, same-age non-reciprocal peer tutoring, same-sex dyad grouping, and more weekly tutoring sessions but longer tutoring time for each session.

63,Signals and systems is a course that introduces students to mathematical concepts that are used to analyze systems or signals. In Wentworth Institute of Technology signals and systems was taught in the conventional way using lecture and readings to explain the theory and by assigning paper-based problem sets of theory and math. Conceptual understanding of the course content remained a challenge for many undergraduate students. A series of laboratory exercises was developed to help students visualize the complex mathematical concepts and gain a better appreciation for how the concepts are useful in real-world situations. Some of the exercises were hardware based hands-on activities and others were software based simulations. Hardware based hands-on included amplitude modulation (AM). demodulation. and sampling by Telecommunication Instructional Modelling System (TIMS). Software-based simulation exercises included filter design and signal synthesis to strengthen understanding of the frequency response. Evaluations were based on student performance of the new laboratory assignments. course grade. and student surveys (course evaluations). Recent offerings of this course taught in the traditional way by the same instructors resulted in only 53% of the students receiving a ?B-? or higher grade for the course. In the first iteration of new laboratory exercises. the number of students who received a ?B-? or better increased to 76%. Moreover. 87% of students ?agree? or ?strongly agree? that the laboratory exercises helped them to better learn the course content. 81% ?of the students agree? or ?strongly agree? that laboratory exercises increased their interest in the subject.

64,In today?s ports. the storage area is often the bottleneck in the serving of a vessel. It is therefore an important influencing factor in the minimization of the turnaround time of the vessels. which is the main objective in operational planning in container terminals. The operational planning of the yard cranes strongly impacts the yard?s efficiency. This planning task comprises the assignment of jobs to cranes. the sequencing of jobs per crane and the scheduling of crane movement and job executions subject to time windows and precedence constraints. A common yard configuration is a block storage system with two identical automated gantry cranes. called twin cranes. These cranes are subject to non-crossing constraints and therefore often exclusively serve either the landside or the seaside of the terminal. A polynomial-time algorithm for the scheduling subproblem of the cranes is introduced. As the sequencing and assignment part of this planning task is NP-hard. the overall problem is solved heuristically with a branch and bound procedure that includes the introduced scheduling algorithm as an evaluation subroutine. A computational study is presented to test the performance of this approach against a mathematical program solved by CPLEX.   2019. Springer Science+Business Media. LLC. part of Springer Nature.
65,This article takes the discipline of knowledge management in organizations and applies it to the academic library setting. Knowledge management studies inefficiencies in information sharing within organizations and proposes solutions. In the academic library. the one-shot library instruction session is largely inadequate in teaching students how to use library databases. particularly for advanced assignments. Follow-up contact such as workshops or individual instruction sessions requires time and initiative from students. and this contact very often does not occur. This denies students the opportunity to experience much of the crucial subject knowledge of the librarian. This kind of unshared subject librarian knowledge corresponds to a key concept of knowledge management called tacit knowledge. Tacit knowledge refers to both knowledge that is unshared in an organization as well as knowledge that is difficult to document and transmit. Social media platforms and course software such as LibGuides may offer a solution to enhancing librarian-student teaching. but only if the resource contains a significant amount of previously tacit knowledge (tutorials. links to explanatory reference material. course-specific search strategies. and more). A key goal for librarians should be sharing and making easily accessible previously undocumented subject-specific knowledge. This article evaluates different ways of sharing knowledge using LibGuides and social media. and how well these forms respond to the information-seeking behavior of students.   2019.   2019 Charles Allan.
66,Version Control Systems are commonly used by Information and communication technology professionals. They allow monitoring the single activity of different people working in the same project through all the project's lifetime. Thus. Version Control Systems are also used by educational institutions. The aim of this work is to demonstrate that the academic success in Computer Sciences subjects may be predicted by monitoring students' interaction with a Version Control System. In order to do so. we have built a prediction model by using Model Evaluator. a tool which allows evaluating several Machine Learning models in order to select the most suitable for a specific problem. A set of experiments are being been carried out to evaluate the prediction model. At those experiments. students of different subjects of the degree in Computer Science of the University of Le n were involved. All the selected subjects: Operating Systems Extension. Computer Programming. and Computer Organization. require students to complete practical assignments which imply developing software solutions in different programming languages. A common requisite of those practical assignments is the use of a Git repository to store source code and documentation. Tentative results suggest that continuous interaction with the Git repositories has a big impact on academic success.   2019 ACM.
67,Spatial awareness and the ability to analyze spatial objects. manipulate them and assess the effect thereof. is a key competence for industrial designers. Skills are gradually built up throughout most educational design programs. starting with exercises on technical drawings and reconstruction or classification of spatial objects from isometric projections and CAD practice. The accuracy in which spatial assignments are conducted and the amount of effort required to fulfill them. highly depend on individual insight. interests and persistence. Thus each individual has its own struggles and learning curve to master the structure of spatial objects in aesthetic and functional design. Virtual reality (VR) is a promising tool to expose subjects to objects with complex spatial structure. and even manipulate and design spatial characteristics of such objects. The advantage of displaying spatial objects in VR. compared to representations by projecting them on a screen or paper. could be that subjects could more accurately assess spatial properties of and object and its full geometrical and/or mechanical complexity. when exposed to that object in VR. Immersive experience of spatial objects. could not only result in faster acquiring spatial insights. but also potentially with less effort. We propose that acquiring spatial insight in VR could leverage individual differences in skills and talents and that under this proposition VR can be used as a promising tool in design education. A first step in underpinning this hypothesis. is acquisition of cognitive workload that can be used and compared both in VR and in a classical teaching context. We use electroencephalography (EEG) to assess brain activity through wearable plug and play headset (Wearable Sensing-DSI 7). This equipment is combined with VR (Oculus). We use QStates classification software to compare brain waves when conducting spatial assessments on paper and in VR. This gives us a measure of cognitive workload. as a ratio of a resulting from subject records with a presumed ?high? workload. A total number of eight records of subjects were suited for comparison. No significant difference was found between EEG signals (paried t-test. p = 0.57). However the assessment of cognitive workload was successfully validated through a questionnaire. The method could be used to set up reliable constructs for learning techniques for spatial insights.   Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.
68,The aim of the work was to get acquainted in detail with the framework educational programs for secondary schools and on their basis to create the questionnaire for secondary schools. which will find out which programs are used in schools in the subjects of informatics. in the field of multimedia. From detailed research. the authors received detailed information about the most widely used programs. They are the following ones - Gimp. Zoner Draw 5. Audacity. 3D Paint. and Video Editor. Presentations were created for these programs in a uniform form (for each software separately). which serve as a guide to the use of the program and a set of worksheets. including a longer-term project. Worksheets are created independently of the software. contain thematically defined assignments and evaluation methods. They can therefore also be used independently of presentations. The difficulty is based on questionnaires - according to the number of hours that schools devote to individual topics. After the completion of the presentations. the materials were sent to schools and. based on the feedback (second questionnaire). the shortcomings and inadequacies that were originally in the materials were corrected.   2020 Danube Adria Association for Automation and Manufacturing.

69,"The use of instructional media is something that can support the teaching and learning process, therefore. a lecturer must have the ability to create and develop learning media. This study aims to improve student learning outcomes in building physics course by using simulation learning media and models to help students understand thermal comfort material. Making modelling and simulation media is done using MATLAB software. The subjects of this study were physics engineering students who took Building Physics course. At the beginning of the study. students are given material and then in groups discuss thermal contents and then given a pretest test with an average score of 70.27. and for an average grade of 71.3 assignments. At the meeting next week. using the Student-Centered Learning (SCL) method and using problem-based learning in groups. students take temperature measurements in several rooms in the Building at the UNAS Physical Engineering Laboratory. The measurement results show that the room does not have thermal requirements (PERGUB No. 38/2012). so students have the task of conducting experiments using models that have been created by researchers to create learning media to improve comfort in using thermal buildings. Simulation results carried out by students. that is. can produce rooms with thermal conditions at 21-25 C (PERGUB No. 38/2012). This simulation is also able to provide the score of building energy efficiency. After students succeed in conducting the test. the assessment test or posttest is carried out with an average score obtained 80.55. and an average score of 80 assignments. The results of the pretest. assignment 1. assignment 2. and posttest show an increase in students? scores of 14.6% for the Test and Task Score of 12.20%. Based on the hypothesis test. for both variables showed t-count < t-table and significance < 0.05. It shows there are significant differences in student learning outcomes both test scores and assignment scores before and after using a simulated media. Thus. the system and simulation model designed can be used as learning media that can improve student learning outcomes.   2020 Science Education Study Program FMIPA UNNES Semarang."
70,"Background: Capturing the scale of child maltreatment is difficult. but few would argue that it is anything less than a global problem which can affect victims? health and well-being throughout their life. Systems of detection. investigation and intervention for maltreated children are the subject of continued review and debate. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of the formal use of family group decision-making (FGDM) in terms of child safety. permanence (of child's living situation). child and family well-being. and client satisfaction with the decision-making process. Search Methods: Both published and unpublished manuscripts were considered eligible for this review. Library staff from Scholarly Information (Brownless Biomedical Library) University of Melbourne. conducted 14 systematic bibliographic searches. Reviewers also checked the reference lists of all relevant articles obtained. and reference lists from previously published reviews. Researchers also hand-searched 10 relevant journals. Selection Criteria: Study samples of children and young people. aged 0?18 years. who have been the subject of a child maltreatment investigation. were eligible for this review. Studies had to have used random assignment to create treatment and control groups, or. parallel cohorts in which groups were assessed at the same point in time. Any form of FGDM. used in the course of a child maltreatment investigation or service. was considered an eligible intervention if it involved: a concerted effort to convene family. extended family. and community members, and professionals, and involved a planned meeting with the intention of working collaboratively to develop a plan for the safety well-being of children, with a focus on family-centred decision-making. Data Collection and Analysis: Two review authors independently extracted the necessary data from each study report. using the software application Covidence. Covidence highlighted discrepancies between data extracted by separate reviewers. further analysis was conducted until a consensus was reached on what data were to be included in the review. Two authors also independently conducted analyses of study bias. Main Results: Eighteen eligible study reports were found. providing findings from 15 studies. involving 18 study samples. Four were randomised controlled trials (RCTs, N = 941) the remainder employed quasi-experimental designs with parallel cohorts. Three of the quasi-experimental studies used prospective evaluations of nonrandomly assigned comparison groups (N = 4.368), the rest analysed pre-existing survey data. child protection case files or court data (N = 91.786). The total number of children studied was 97.095. The longest postintervention follow-up period was 3 years. Only four studies were conducted outside the United States, two in Canada and one in Sweden and one in the Netherlands. The review authors judged there to be a moderate or high risk of bias. in most of the bias categories considered. Only one study referenced a study protocol. Eleven of the fifteen studies were found to have a high likelihood of selection bias (73%). Baseline imbalance bias was deemed to be unlikely in just two studies. and highly likely in nine (60%). Confounding variables were judged to be highly likely in four studies (27%). and contamination bias was judged highly likely in five studies (33%). Researcher allegiance was rated as a high risk in three studies (20%) where the authors argued for the benefits of FGDM within the article. but without supporting references to an appropriate evidence base. Bias from differential diagnostic activity. and funding source bias. were less evident across the evidence reviewed. This review combines findings for eight FGDM outcome measures. Findings from RCTs were available for four outcomes. but none of these. combined in meta-analysis or otherwise. were statistically significant. Combining findings from the quasi-experimental studies provided one statisti"
71,In anticipation of the introduction of the elective subject of Information Sciences for the lower grades of primary school. a question of the professional teaching competences of students - future teachers and current teachers of Information Sciences (with an emphasis on programing). comes into the focus. This article discusses their ability from professional (knowledge of programing) and pedagogical aspects. We present the results of a research conducted among students of the Faculty of Education Sciences with a module in Information Sciences and Informatics Teachers in the Class Teaching study group. Respondents. through self-evaluation of their knowledge and competencies in the field of programing. gave answers from which it can be concluded whether they are ready to teach programing. The article also presents a case study in which students of the final year of the Faculty of Education Sciences with a module of Information Sciences. made a video clip of processing new contents for a programing class. as a methodical exercise. The programing languages used were Scratch. Python and the micro:bit simulator. Project assignments were correlated with the subjects of Croatian language. Physical and Health Culture. Music Culture. Mathematics and Information Sciences. The results of the research indicate that the respondents are generally ready. but they would need additional education in programing domain.   2020 Croatian Society MIPRO.
72,This Innovate Practice Full Paper presents our experience with teaching a cybersecurity course to undergraduate students utilizing terminal sessions recording software as a pedagogical tool.Developing a practical cybersecurity course demands numerous amount of preparation and the deployment of various security tools. One of the significant benefits of providing hands-on assignments is the opportunity for students to practice and experiment with tools similar to the ones used by both the professionals and malicious actors.This paper presents an innovative approach to conducting interactive demonstrations in the classroom and as a supplement to the weekly practical assignments. By combining two simple open-source software. we managed to create several short tutorials on how to use various command-line security tools. The educational tool was deployed in an undergraduate cybersecurity class. and the results from the anonymous online survey were overwhelmingly positive. Furthermore. the participants responded that the demos improved their understanding of the subject content and enabled them to learn the material effectively.   2020 IEEE.
73,Project Based Learning (PBL) develops student knowledge and skills through solving authentic. engaging and complex challenge in a fixed time span. Academic literature reports its application over a wide variety of disciplines. having both immediate and long-lasting positive effect on team working. project management. and creativity when applying technical skills. We aim to enhance student learning in software engineering. 80% of student respondents up to the date feel that programming assignments that last longer than a week overlap with other subjects enough to draw dedication away. While it unquestionably develops transferable skills. such as time management. it also might not necessarily be good through introductory courses. where students face completely new material. As a result. our aim is to employ 'hackathon'-a gathering. where programmers collaboratively code in an extreme manner over 12 to 24 hours-as a teaching tool. While there is a precedent of hackathon being used at University level. it was employed to substitute classic approach via excluding lecturing and lab work completely. Current paper presents research design and relevant discussion on measuring and validating learning outcomes when blending hackathon into traditional programming class as one of the components. not a substitute to other types of classes.   2018 IEEE.
74,In this paper. the procedure for the strength evaluation of the piping system installed on liquefied natural gas (LNG) carriers is discussed. A procedure that accounts for the ship?s wave load and hull motion acceleration (as well as the deformation due to the thermal expansion and contraction experienced by the hull during seafaring operations) is presented. The load due to the temperature and self-weight of the piping installed on the deck is also considered. Various operating and load conditions of the LNG piping system are analyzed. Stress analysis is performed by combining various conditions of sustained. occasional. and expansion loads. Stress is assessed using finite element analysis based on beam elements that represent the behavior of the piping. The attributes of the piping system components (such as valves. expansion joints. and supports) are represented in the finite element model while CAESAR-II. a commercial software is used for finite element analysis. Component modeling. load assignment. and load combinations are presented to evaluate pipe stresses under various load conditions. An evaluation model is selected for the piping arrangement of LNG and the evaluated stress is compared with the allowable stress defined by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).   2020 by the authors.

75,Collaborative learning (CL) is an active learning method that has been shown to improve students' learning. Although the integration of CL in small face-to-face lectures was implemented and evaluated successfully. the implementation within large (e.g.. over 200 students) and remote settings is still a subject of research. Challenges such as the goal-oriented group formation of students with spatial or even geographical disparity. or the collaboration itself prevent the actual use. Thus. our goal is to overcome those issues and enable CL in the most diverse classrooms. Therefore. we present a prototype that combines the idea of Audience Response Systems (ARSs). which allow students to participate during the lecture using their mobile devices. with short-term collaborative activities. Based on students' previously given answers. our approach allows the formation of groups using different algorithms and settings. Within these groups. several types of interactions can be defined. e.g.. a chat is provided to initiate discussions. or a voting to determine a group answer. The approach is designed to be highly customizable by allowing lecturers to create their individual teaching scenarios based on elements defined in a unified metamodel. All runtime data that is not specified by this model. e.g.. the assignment of students to groups. is added using the concept of roles.   2020 IEEE.
76,In Reliability analysis. there are four main steps to perform. These steps are selection of the mathematical model that represents system states. selection of the mathematical representation that represents the operation of the system. quantitative and qualitative reliability analysis and to conclude the obtained results. In Faculty of Management Science and Informatics. there is a course called Reliability engineering in which reliability analysis is taught. During the course. the students are taught about the basic of the reliability engineering and reliability analysis. During this process. there are various topics that can be more challenging for a student. such as computation of the Importance measures. Thanks to this. we developed a software tool for such computation and this tool is also usable for the research activities in our faculty. By implementing this software tool in the teaching process in subject of the reliability engineering the students can better understand. how these measures can be computed and how can they be used for localizing weak spots in the system. Results from this tool can be then used in term projects and assignments by students of in research activities that uses these measures in reliability analysis.   2020 IEEE.
77,The cold standby redundancy technique has been applied to develop a stochastic model for a two unit computer system. One unit (computer system) is initially operative and the second unit (computer system) is in cold standby. Each unit comprises two main components hardware and software. To handle the repair activities of the components (i.e. hardware and software). a single service facility (server) is provided. The failure of service facility is considered during the up-gradation of the software. The prescribed assignments are resumed with full efficiency by service facility after treatment. The failure rates of the components are assumed as constant. The hardware repair?s rate. software?s up-gradation rate and server?s treatment rate follow arbitrary probability distributions. The SMP and RPT are adopted to determine various reliability measures of the computer system model. And. also the profit of the system model has been obtained. The interpretation of the results is given wherever necessary and graphs are drawn to show the trend of MTCSF. availability and Profit Function of the system model.   2020 DAV College.

78,ROS (Robot Operating System) is currently the most popular robotic software development framework. Robotic software in safe-critical domain are usually subject to hard real-time constraints. so designers must formally model and analyze their timing behaviors to guarantee that real-time constraints are always honored at runtime. This paper studies real-time scheduling and analysis of processing chains in ROS2. the second-generation ROS with a major consideration of real-time capability. First. we study response time analysis of processing chains on ROS2 executors. We show that the only existing result of this problem is both optimistic and pessimistic. and develop new techniques to address these problems and significantly improve the analysis precision. Second. we reveal that the response time of a processing chain on an executor only depends on its last scheduling entity (callback). which provides useful guidance for designers to improve not only the response time bound. but also the actual worst-case/average response time of the system at little design cost. We conduct experiments with both randomly generated workload and a case study on realistic ROS2 platforms to evaluate and demonstrate our results.   2020 IEEE.
79,"Many works in the literature highlight the importance of formative assessment to improve the learning process. Formative assessment means providing assignments to the students and giving them feedback during the course. It is not very used in Italian Universities because it is highly time-consuming for the professors. that typically do not have help in the process of homework grading.In this work. we focus on programming exercises in computer science subjects. and propose a tool to semi-automatically grade and give feedback to the students. The tool was used in a computer language course on functional programming in a M.Sc. degree, the students evaluation of the course show a steep increase in the students appreciation. The tool is currently used in a course at undergraduate level on C programming.   2020 IEEE."
80,In many social science experiments. subjects often interact with each other and as a result one unit?s treatment influences the outcome of another unit. Over the last decade. a significant progress has been made toward causal inference in the presence of such interference between units. Researchers have shown that the two-stage randomization of treatment assignment enables the identification of average direct and spillover effects. However. much of the literature has assumed perfect compliance with treatment assignment. In this article. we establish the nonparametric identification of the complier average direct and spillover effects in two-stage randomized experiments with interference and noncompliance. In particular. we consider the spillover effect of the treatment assignment on the treatment receipt as well as the spillover effect of the treatment receipt on the outcome. We propose consistent estimators and derive their randomization-based variances under the stratified interference assumption. We also prove the exact relationships between the proposed randomization-based estimators and the popular two-stage least squares estimators. The proposed methodology is motivated by and applied to our own randomized evaluation of India?s National Health Insurance Program (RSBY). where we find some evidence of spillover effects. The proposed methods are implemented via an open-source software package.

81,This review covers recent developments in glycosaminoglycan (GAG) analysis via mass spectrometry (MS). GAGs participate in a variety of biological functions. including cellular communication. wound healing. and anticoagulation. and are important targets for structural characterization. GAGs exhibit a diverse range of structural features due to the variety of O- and N-sulfation modifications and uronic acid C-5 epimerization that can occur. making their analysis a challenging target. Mass spectrometry approaches to the structure assignment of GAGs have been widely investigated. and new methodologies remain the subject of development. Advances in sample preparation. tandem MS techniques (MS/MS). online separations. and automated analysis software have advanced the field of GAG analysis. These recent developments have led to remarkable improvements in the precision and time efficiency for the structural characterization of GAGs.   2021 THE AUTHORS.

82,The traditional approach to teaching computer system and IOT involves the presentation of a large amount of theoretical and mathematical data and materials to students. The common approach is a theoretical explanation of the principles. on the whiteboard and if possible. with the use of graphical animations. The main issue in this area is raising interactivity and getting collaboration between students on project assignments. In this paper. authors are proposing more interactive approach that could be beneficial to teachers of related subjects. Presented are the results of using software and simulating tools (in combination with Arduino hardware development solution) for teaching collaboratively and interactively courses related to IoT. The paper presents ideas for implementation of practical and experimental project assignments. student engagement and collaboration. The paper also presents the results of authors after applying this approach to one generation of students. The application access with practical assignments gave markedly better results. measured through student engagement. classroom attendance and distribution of student results. In this manner. the students had a better understanding of the basics of the microcontrollers. sensors. IoT and were willing to engage in programming of microcontrollers at the lower level. Students have also shown better results in closely related courses such as the courses of operating systems. In addition. some students continued to use IoT platforms for future projects (in college or practice).   2021 TEMPUS Publications.
83,The purpose of this study is to use linear programming in order to determine the optimal structure of a multidisciplinary team. A multidisciplinary team consists of different types of members (disciplines) and different types of work. Each team member can be assigned to one or more type of work. depending on the design of the team. A number of work hours for each type of work will be provided for the system and distributed for the different types of workers of the team. Furthermore. the model. including the structure of the team. the types of workers and types of work in consideration can be for any industry. The objective will be to minimize the cost of each team and provide the ground work to use the optimization method for multiple teams such as multiple teams assigned to subsystems of a system with the ability to share team members. combine multiple minimization subjects. and perform optimization for multiple phases of a project. The significance of this study is to be able to design a team which is optimized for the system and its resources. The study uses an optimization model which allows for the formation and optimization of a team in any industry. In addition. the study can be used by any industry to design a team which is best suited for its operation. resources. and requirements. The team formation problem involves the forming of a team from a collection of workers with skills and qualities that are suited for the project at hand. The study expands the idea of the multidisciplinary team formation as an extension of the team formation and assignment problem.

84,In this paper we address the Mission Scheduling (MS) problem for Engineering and Manufacturing Development flight test operations. i.e.. determining which aircraft to schedule for specified missions and how many missions are scheduled. We account for a squadron of shared aircraft that are utilized for specific mission assignments. We consider the system reliability and mission requirements for multi-ship missions to maximize the number of missions flown. Since flight test is a necessary and costly endeavor. maximizing the efficiency of a flight test program is critical to the overall success of a program. Aborted missions. due to aircraft unavailability. delay the program and increase the overall cost. We have performed a sensitivity analysis utilizing the aircraft reliability data. which determines the system reliability. The reliability sensitivity results show the effect that increases or decreases in the aircraft reliability have on mission scheduling. Additionally. sensitivity of the Mission Reliability (MR) requirement has been analyzed. The MR requirement reflects the acceptable risk a program has determined when scheduling missions. The MS problem optimization has been implemented using the Excel Solver add-in. Due to the sensitive nature of aircraft capabilities and reliability data. the input data have been approximated based on subject matter expertise.   2021 IISE Annual Conference and Expo 2021.

85,CONTEXT As its name suggests. peer assessment involves each student to take active part in providing feedback and in some cases. evaluation of the learning outcome of their peers. Peer assessment can introduce several advantages to the learning process such as increasing the student motivation. critical thinking and development of qualitative and quantitative arguments. This research proposes a peer assessment method for computational-based assignments and describes the process of implementing it in an online ?Structural Analysis? subject. PURPOSE OR GOAL Some experts have criticised peer assessment procedures and questioned the ability of students to provide reliable evaluation. There are concerns raised in the literature on the usefulness and reliability of student peer reviews including inconsistency in the feedback and quantitative assessment marks. This study aims to implement an online tool to increase the engagement and partnership of students in the virtual environment and replace some of the lengthy computational processes with computer-based tools. The goal of the proposed method is also to increase the reliability of peer assessment activity by providing evidence-based evaluations. APPROACH OR METHODOLOGY/METHODS The design of the peer assessment task has been implemented in a second year ?Structural Analysis? subject on the topic of ?Analysing Indeterminate Structures?. The delivery of this task was examined in a methodological approach as well as an executional approach. In the methodological approach. benefits were investigated. and comparison was made with previous peer-assessment procedures. The execution of this task which includes a combination of manual calculations and computer methods is outlined using available LMS tools. ACTUAL OR ANTICIPATED OUTCOMES The method proposed in this study introduces benefits to student learning and engagement in theoretical computational-based topics. This method is built on suggestions to mitigate some of the downsides of peer assessment reported in previous literature. For instance. to escape the double volume of computational effort. to reduce the reluctancy of students and to eliminate the potential errors they make in evaluating the computational work of their peers. the assessment phase is proposed to be done using a ?Structural Analysis? computer software. CONCLUSIONS/RECOMMENDATIONS/SUMMARY Online peer assessment combining theoretical methods and computer-based approaches has provided a means to overcome some of the shortcomings traditionally associated with this approach. These improvements include an increase in the level of consistency and reliability of peer-assessment results compared to traditional approaches. The implementation of the method also shows approximately 25% increase in student active participation. Copyright   Fatemeh Javidan. 2021.
86,"Computing theory is an important part of computer science education. introducing students to computational models of increasing power to study possibilities and limitations of computation. The subject is. however. very abstract and mathematical. and students often struggle with it. Students must master various computational models. but there is often a lengthy delay from the time a model is introduced until a student gets feedback on their related assignment. During this time. the course has typically moved far ahead. and students become progressively more lost. To alleviate this problem. we developed a prototype of an automated feedback tool for CS theory. which extends the widely used JFLAP software. Our tool currently handles student submissions of deterministic and non-deterministic finite automata. regular expressions. context-free grammars. and push-down automata homework. where an instructor specifies the target language and the students receive immediate feedback on their submissions. Currently. for incorrect submissions. the feedback is in the form of a witness string. specifying a string on which the submission fails. Beyond regular languages. our tool attempts to solve undecidable problems, fortunately. the undecidability does not occur on typical homework assignments. We are collecting preliminary evaluation data from students using the prototype tool in their course. In our future work. we will analyze the data. and we aim to produce automated partial credit (along with the witness feedback) using SAT and QBF solvers.   2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

87,Release is a ubiquitous concept in software development. referring to grouping multiple independent changes into a deliverable piece of software. Mining releases can help developers understand the software evolution at coarse grain. identify which features were delivered or bugs were fixed. and pinpoint who contributed on a given release. A typical initial step of release mining consists of identifying which commits compose a given release. We could find two main strategies used in the literature to perform this task: time-based and range-based. Some release mining works recognize that those strategies are subject to misclassifications but do not quantify the impact of such a threat. This paper analyzed 13. 419 releases and 1. 414. 997 commits from 100 relevant open source projects hosted at GitHub to assess both strategies in terms of precision and recall. We observed that. in general. the range-based strategy has superior results than the time-based strategy. Nevertheless. even when the range-based strategy is in place. some releases still show misclassifications. Thus. our paper also discusses some situations in which each strategy degrades. potentially leading to bias on the mining results if not adequately known and avoided.   2021 IEEE.
88,The network flow problem is one of the subject matters of graph theory application. Given the project assignments to solve real problems network flow problems. So that students have created in terms of visual communication poster-based learning is used to present problem-solving projects. A poster is a media in the form of a simplified illustration of object images that further emphasizes the power of the message. visual. with a combination of colors to express the idea of a particular fact or event. A Rasch measurement model with Winsteps software was used to analyze 54 respondents (male 8. Female 46). Visual communication rubric uses posters with 5 criteria with Rasch analysis results for polytomous data obtained by Person Reliability 0.83. The suitability level of the ideal model of measurement (item fit) is obtained outfit means square (0.5 MNSQ 1.5. infit means square (0.5 MNSQ 1.5). and point measure correlation (0.4 Pt Measure Corr 0.85. To see the map of the distribution of students' abilities used Wright map (Person-item Map) analysis. while to analyze the students' abilities the person measure is used which can be seen in the measure order table which sequentially shows the students' abilities from the highest to the lowest. The DIF items are used to analyze whether there is a bias in gender. in this case. it is obtained that the four criteria of probability values of more than 5% (0.05) there is one whose probability value 0.05 can be explained also by person DIF Plot there are male students who in the fourth criterion the ability is lower than average. The Rasch modeling application can be used to analyze education assessments that are more complex and detailed. The Rasch model can be used to analyze multiple-choice test questions. true/false questions (dichotomous data). essay questions with the same score (polytomous data). and essay questions with different scores for each question (polytomous data with Partial Credit Model).   2021 Author(s).
89,"Modern Web Applications rely on architectures usually designed with modular software components whose be-haviour is shaped over fundamental principles and characteristics of the HTTP protocol. Dependency Injection frameworks support designers and developers in the automated management of components lifecycle. binding them to predefined scopes. thus delegating to an outer and independent participant the responsibility of creation. destruction and inter-dependencies definition of runtime instances. In this way. different scopes configurations implicitly act as different software micro-rejuvenation policies. emphasising the importance of choices in the assignment of component scopes, while supporting the stateful behaviour in data-retention mechanism. wider scopes may majorly expose inmemory components to software aging processes. We report a practical experience illustrating how the memory maintained in the business logic of a Web Application may give space to aging processes affecting the runtime behaviour of a stateful web application. and we show how this threat is contrasted by micro-rejuvenation at component level implemented by the container under different assignment strategies for components scopes. To this end. we propose an accelerated testing approach relying on a fault injection process that executes an event-driven simulation of arising soft errors over time. Experimentation on an exemplary web application implemented on the stack of Java Enterprise Edition show how manifestation. correction. and propagation of errors are conditioned by different scopes assigned to components by the software developer.   2021 IEEE."
90,Technologists are required to perform a variety of communication methods after graduation. Industry has begun producing videos as a communication method for marketing and also requiring videos as part of the employment process. Videos have become prevalent in the workplace and at home. As many students have access to video cameras in their mobile phones and access to inexpensive video-editing software. uploading videos has become a normal activity. This research builds on previous research about YouTube videos as a student assignment. The video project incorporates the student-as-teacher approach for a research presentation. Further. the video project utilizes experiential learning to encourage students to enter new areas of social media. specifically YouTube. Instead of an in-class presentation. students were asked to create instructional videos like those they view online. The students were asked to present Engineering Technology related research topics. The research topics were in addition or to expound upon topics identified in the course. Students not only had to communicate technical content but communicate it to a layperson in an easily understood manner. This is one of the most valuable traits of a technologist. to communicate between the theoretical/technical side to an audience with little expertise on the subject. Non-technical faculty also reviewed the videos to validate whether technology students have mastered this important communication skill. Two groups of students were given the same video project framework: construction management technology and computer technology. The combined dataset of the students will be used to determine similarities and disparities in communication. interest. and project format of the two groups.

91,The manufacturing cell formation represents one of the important stages of the construction of cellular manufacturing systems. It focuses on grouping machines. parts and workers and assigning them to the corresponding cells. This assignment is guided by multiple objectives. and is subject to many constraints. In this paper. the focus is made on a variant of the cell formation problem. which is the Generalized Cubic Cell Formation Problem (GCCFP). In this study. a mathematical model is developed for this variant of the problem. Besides the multiple objectives considered in most research works. the quality index of the produced parts is also considered in this study. To solve the problem. a Discrete Flower Pollination Algorithm (DFPA) is developed. To validate the model and the DFPA. a set of randomly generated instances were solved using B&B under LINGO software. DFPA and Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm. The performance of DFPA. from the standpoint of the considered objectives and the time of calculation. has been tested. The experiment results show the efficiency of the developed method.   2020 Elsevier Ltd
92,In the coming years. the dominance of video in global Internet traffic is expected to intensify due to the ongoing migration from analog CCTV to IP-based surveillance systems. As opposed to analog. IP cameras can be integrated into pre-existing computer networks and thus. are more cost-effective. However. since video is bandwidth intensive. contention among the streams from multiple IP cameras and traffic from other applications results to a severely degraded network performance. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is a relatively new paradigm which aims to build dynamically configurable networks. The decoupling of forwarding and control functions in SDN architecture enables a centralized controller to create a map of the network topology by utilizing the information collected from the switches. This paper proposes an SDN-based framework to enhance the performance of IP Video Surveillance (IPVS) systems deployed over underprovisioned networks. As a means of allowing the controller to infer a stream's QoS metrics and to execute bitrate adjustment or rerouting as necessary. two video quality indicators were also formulated by utilizing the statistics messages available in OpenFlow. a widely recognized protocol in SDN. Moreover. our design is built on the idea that the video streams in surveillance systems offer different utilities depending on the captured event. Experimental results show that employing the proposed framework improved the video streams' overall packet loss. latency. jitter and throughput by 88{\%}. 36{\%}. 11{\%} and 5{\%} respectively. The comparison of the video streams' QoS metrics also suggests that the framework is capable of prioritizing the reception of selected streams. Furthermore. we also demonstrate that the proposed framework can be easily extended to handle the case of an IPVS system wherein the streams are subjected to dynamic priority assignment.

93,Background: Clinical trial articles often lack detailed descriptions of the methods used to randomize participants. conceal allocation. and blind subjects and investigators to group assignment. We describe our systematic approach to implement and measure blinding success in a double-blind phase 2 randomized controlled trial testing the efficacy of acupuncture for the treatment of vulvodynia. Methods: Randomization stratified by vulvodynia subtype is managed by Research Electronic Data Capture software?s randomization module adapted to achieve complete masking of group allocation. Subject and acupuncturist blinding assessments are conducted multiple times to identify possible correlates of unblinding. Results: At present. 48 subjects have been randomized and completed the protocol resulting in 87 subject and 206 acupuncturist blinding assessments. Discussion: Our approach to blinding and blinding assessment has the potential to improve our understanding of unblinding over time in the presence of possible clinical improvement.

94,Introduction: Menopause is one of the risk factors for knee osteoarthritis which causes complications such as pain and movement restriction. Involving people in treatment programs such as self-care interventions has been associated with beneficial results. This study was performed with aim to evaluate the effects of water exercise training on motor symptoms and physical pains in postmenopausal women with knee osteoarthritis. Methods: This randomized clinical trial study was performed with participation of 42 women in Tabriz University of Medical Sciences in 2019. After random assignment of the subjects to the intervention and control groups. the intervention group performed simple water exercises for 12 sessions (50 minutes each session). Data were collected using Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score questionnaire. Data were analyzed by SPSS software (version 20) and Kolmogorov-Smirnov. Fisher exact. Chi-square and independent t-test. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: The mean total score of osteoarthritis in the intervention group before the intervention was 121.15   12.90 and in the control group was 129.19  11.49. which was not significantly different (p= 0.209). but after receiving the intervention. statistically significant difference was observed between the intervention group (74.81   5.55) and the control group (127.12   11.89) (p= 0.0001). Conclusion: Simple water exercises improve physical pain and osteoarthritis symptoms in postmenopausal women.   2021. Mashhad University of Medical Sciences. All rights reserved.
95,"Thanks to its computational and forwarding capabilities. the mobile network infrastructure can support several third-party (""vertical"") services. each composed of a graph of virtual (network) functions (VNFs). Importantly. one or more VNFs are often common to multiple services. thus the services deployment cost could be reduced by letting the services share the same VNF instance instead of devoting a separate instance to each service. By doing that. however. it is critical that the target KPI (key performance indicators) of all services are met. To this end. we study the VNF sharing problem and make decisions on 1) when sharing VNFs among multiple services is possible. 2) how to adapt the virtual machines running the shared VNFs to the combined load of the assigned services. and 3) how to prioritize the services traffic within shared VNFs. All decisions aim to minimize the cost for the mobile operator. subject to requirements on end-to-end service performance. e.g.. total delay. Notably. we show that the aforementioned priorities should be managed dynamically and vary across VNFs. We then propose the FlexShare algorithm to provide near-optimal VNF-sharing and priority assignment decisions in polynomial time. We prove that FlexShare is within a constant factor from the optimum and. using real-world VNF graphs. we show that it consistently outperforms baseline solutions.

96,"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in many changes in the way research is conducted. Some specific groups (e. g. women) and activities (e.g. teaching) may have been disproportionally affected. Our aim was to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on animal behaviour and welfare researchers? work experience and productivity. focussing on gender. care role. career stage and teaching load. An online survey asked researchers about childcare. research and teaching load and associated changes due to the pandemic. among others. and included the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and the Inventory of Socially Supportive Behaviours (ISSB). From JuneJuly 2020. 117 completed responses were received from 28 countries. Time available for writing papers and grants either increased (36 {\%}). decreased (31 {\%}) or these tasks were halted completely (12 {\%}). Perceived productivity was significantly lower for caregivers (P {\textless} 0.001) and for men as compared to women (P {\textless} 0.001), and low productivity was associated with more stress (higher PSS: P {\textless} 0.001). Respondents? experience of the pandemic related to the PSS (b = -0.03 ? 0.02, P = 0.03) and to self-assessed personality traits (P = 0.01). The average PSS of 21 ? 6.5 was greater than the reference value of 15. and was higher when respondents had low job security (P {\textless} 0.001) and when they more strongly characterised themselves as perfectionists. hard-working. empathetic and worried (P = 0.02). Respondents who had an intense care role received most social support (P = 0.04). Teaching load increased for 25 {\%} of the respondents but did not significantly relate to any of the response variables. Overall. caregivers and early career researchers faced the most difficulties. and personality traits had a major impact on the ability to cope with the changes caused by the pandemic.

98,The glycosylation profile of biotherapeutic glycoproteins is a critical quality attribute that is routinely monitored to ensure desired product quality. safety and efficacy. Additionally. as one of the most prominent and complex post-translational modifications. glycosylation plays a key role in disease manifestation. Changes in glycosylation may serve as a specific and sensitive biomarker for disease diagnostics and prognostics. However. the conventional 2-aminobenzamide-based N-glycosylation analysis procedure is time-consuming and insensitive with poor reproducibility. We have evaluated an innovative streamlined 96-well-plate-based platform utilizing InstantPC label for high-throughput. high-sensitivity glycan profiling. which is user-friendly. robust and ready for automation. However. the limited availability of InstantPC-labeled glycan standards has significantly hampered the applicability and transferability of this platform for expedited glycan structural profiling. To address this challenge. we have constructed a detailed InstantPC-labeled glycan glucose unit (GU) database through analysis of human serum and a variety of other glycoproteins from various sources. Following preliminary hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) with fluorescence detection separation and analysis. glycoproteins with complex glycan profiles were subjected to further fractionation by weak anion exchange HILIC and exoglycosidase sequential digestion for cross-validation of the glycan assignment. Hydrophilic interaction ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was subsequently utilized for glycan fragmentation and accurate glycan mass confirmation. The constructed InstantPC glycan GU database is accurate and robust. It is believed that this database will enhance the application of the developed platform for high-throughput. high-sensitivity glycan profiling and that it will eventually advance glycan-based biopharmaceutical production and disease biomarker discovery.

99,"The gut microbiota composition of intensive care unit (ICU) patients suffering from Clostridium difficile-positive diarrhea (CDpD) is poorly understood. This prospective study aims to use 16S rDNA (and metagenome) sequencing to compare the microbiota composition of 58 (and 5) ICU patients with CDpD (CDpD group). 33 (and 4) ICU patients with C. difficile-negative diarrhea (CDnD group). and 21 (and 5) healthy control subjects (control group). as well as CDpD patients in the A(+)B(+) (N = 34, A/B: C. difficile TcdA/B). A(-)B(+) (N = 7). and A(-)B(-) (N = 17) subgroups. For 16S rDNA data. OTU clustering (tool: UPARSE). taxonomic assignment (tool: RDP classifier). alpha-diversity. and beta-diversity analyses (tool: QIIME) were conducted. For metagenome data. metagenome assembly (tool: SOAPdenovo). gene calling (tools: MetaGeneMark. CD-HIT. and SoapAligner). unigene alignment (tool: DIAMOND). taxon difference analysis (tool: Metastats). and gene annotation (tool: DIAMOND) were performed. The microbial diversity of the CDpD group was lower than that of the CDnD and control groups. The abundances of 10 taxa (e.g.. Deferribacteres. Cryptomycota. Acetothermia) were significantly higher in the CDpD group than in the CDnD group. The abundances of Saccharomycetes and Clostridia were significantly lower in CDpD in comparison with control. Some taxa were significantly different between the A(+)B(+) and A(-)B(-) subgroups. CDpD might relate to a decrease in beneficial taxa (i.e.. Saccharomycetes and Clostridia) and an increase in harmful taxa (e.g.. Deferribacteres. Cryptomycota. Acetothermia) in gut microbiota of ICU patients.

100,"Given a set of constraints F and a user-defined weight function W on the assignment space. the problem of constrained sampling is to sample satisfying assignments of F conditioned on W. Constrained sampling is a fundamental problem with applications in probabilistic reasoning. synthesis. software and hardware testing. Consequently. the problem of sampling has been subject to intense theoretical and practical investigations over the years. Despite such intense investigations. there still remains a gap between theory and practice. In particular. there has been significant progress in the development of sampling techniques when W is a uniform distribution. but such techniques fail to handle general weight functions W. Furthermore. we are. often. interested in ?11 formulas. i.e.. (Formula presented) for some F, typically the set of variables Y are introduced as auxiliary variables during encoding of constraints to F. In this context. one wonders whether it is possible to design sampling techniques whose runtime performance is agnostic to the underlying weight distribution and can handle ?11 formulas? The primary contribution of this work is a novel technique. called WAPS. for sampling over ?11 whose runtime is agnostic to W. WAPS is based on our recently discovered connection between knowledge compilation and uniform sampling. WAPS proceeds by compiling F into a well studied compiled form. d-DNNF. which allows sampling operations to be conducted in linear time in the size of the compiled form. We demonstrate that WAPS can significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art weighted and projected sampler WeightGen. by up to 3 orders of magnitude in runtime while achieving a geometric speedup of 296? and solving 564 more instances out of 773. The distribution generated by WAPS is statistically indistinguishable from that generated by an ideal weighted and projected sampler. Furthermore. WAPS is almost oblivious to the number of samples requested.   The Author(s) 2019."
101,A fuzzer provides randomly generated inputs to a targeted software to expose erroneous behavior. To efficiently detect defects. generated inputs should conform to the structure of the input format and thus. grammars can be used to generate syntactically correct inputs. In this context. fuzzing can be guided by probabilities attached to competing rules in the grammar. leading to the idea of probabilistic grammar-based fuzzing. However. the optimal assignment of probabilities to individual grammar rules to effectively expose erroneous behavior for individual systems under test is an open research question. In this paper. we present EvoGFuzz. an evolutionary grammar-based fuzzing approach to optimize the probabilities to generate test inputs that may be more likely to trigger exceptional behavior. The evaluation shows the effectiveness of EvoGFuzz in detecting defects compared to probabilistic grammar-based fuzzing (baseline). Applied to ten real-world applications with common input formats (JSON. JavaScript. or CSS3). the evaluation shows that EvoGFuzz achieved a significantly larger median line coverage for all subjects by up to 48% compared to the baseline. Moreover. EvoGFuzz managed to expose 11 unique defects. from which five have not been detected by the baseline.   2020. Springer Nature Switzerland AG.
102,Orthology assignment is a key step of comparative genomic studies. for which many bioinformatic tools have been developed. However. all gene clustering pipelines are based on the analysis of protein distances. which are subject to many artifacts. In this article. we introduce Broccoli. a user-friendly pipeline designed to infer. with high precision. orthologous groups. and pairs of proteins using a phylogeny-based approach. Briefly. Broccoli performs ultrafast phylogenetic analyses on most proteins and builds a network of orthologous relationships. Orthologous groups are then identified from the network using a parameter-free machine learning algorithm. Broccoli is also able to detect chimeric proteins resulting from gene-fusion events and to assign these proteins to the corresponding orthologous groups. Tested on two benchmark data sets. Broccoli outperforms current orthology pipelines. In addition. Broccoli is scalable. with runtimes similar to those of recent distance-based pipelines. Given its high level of performance and efficiency. this new pipeline represents a suitable choice for comparative genomic studies.

This study investigated the differing microbiota composition in stroke patients and confirmed the association of microbiota composition with poor functional outcome. Between January of 2018 and December of 2019. 198 patients with acute cerebral infarction were included in this study. For the case?control study. age and sex-matched normal healthy subjects (n = 200) were included when receiving their health screening examinations. We isolated bacterial extracellular membrane vesicles and extracted DNA from blood samples. Taxonomic assignments were performed by using the sequence reads of 16S rRNA genes following blood microbiota analysis. Statistical analysis was conducted appropriately by using Statistical Analysis System software. The mean age of the stroke patients were 63.7   12.5 years. and the male sex was 58.5%. Of the total enrolled patients. poor functional outcome (modified Rankin Score ? 3) was noted in 19.7%. The principal component analysis of microbiota composition revealed significant differences between healthy control subjects and stroke patients. At the genus level. Aerococcaceae(f). ZB2(c). TM7-1(c). and Flavobacterium were significantly increased in stroke patients compared to the healthy controls. whereas Mucispirillum. rc4-4. Akkermansia. Clostridiales(o). Lactobacillus. and Stenotrophomonas were decreased considerably. For the functional outcome after ischemic stroke. Anaerococcus. Blautia. Dialister. Aerococcaceae(f). Propionibacterium. Microbacteriaceae(f). and Rothia were enriched in the group with good outcomes. whereas Ruminococcaceae(f) and Prevotella were enriched in the group with poor outcome. There was apparent dysbiosis of blood microbiota in patients with acute ischemic stroke compared to healthy people. Ruminococcaceae(f) and Prevotella were elevated in stroke patients with poor functional outcome.   2021. The Author(s).
104,This study compares two digital flashcard spaced repetition algorithms to evaluate whether the SuperMemo 2 (SM2) algorithm produces better outcomes for law student learning as measured by assessment results than the older Leitner algorithm. Academic staff prepared hundreds of digital flashcards related to an undergraduate law unit ? Introduction to law. Undergraduate law students (n=47) were randomly assigned flashcards using two variations of a software program FlashCram. one version of which used a simple Leitner algorithm. another version the SM2 algorithm for spaced repetition. Students completed three practical assignments. two worth 10%. one worth 20%. and a theoretical examination worth 60% of their final grade. The results confirmed SuperMemo 2 to be a superior algorithm over Leitner with respect to the theoretical examination. There was no significant difference between the algorithms for practical assessment that was skills based. not dependent on memory and not subject to any significant time pressure. The results suggest that the usefulness of spaced repetition digital flashcard systems for legal studies may depend upon the nature of the assessment task.   2018 ASCILITE 2018 - Conference Proceedings - 35th International Conference of Innovation.

105,Legal contracts specify obligations and powers among legal subjects. involve assets. and are subject to quality constraints. Smart contracts are software systems that monitor the execution of contracts to ensure compliance. As a starting point for developing software engineering concepts. tools. and techniques for smart contracts. we have proposed Symboleo. a formal specification language for contracts. The complexity of real-life contracts (e.g.. in the construction and transportation industries) requires specification languages to support execution-time operations for contracts. such as subcontracting. assignment. delegation. and substitution. This paper formalizes such concepts by proposing for them a syntax and axiomatic semantics within Symboleo. This formalization makes use of primitive operations that support the transfer or sharing of right. responsibility. and performance among contracting and subcontracting parties. A prototype compliance checking tool for Symboleo has also been created to support monitoring compliance for contracts that include subcontracting aspects. A realistic freight contract specified in Symboleo is provided as an illustrative example for our proposal. and is used for a preliminary evaluation with positive results.   2020.

106,Objective: This study compares two maps of biomedical sciences using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) term co-assignments versus MeSH terms of citing/cited articles and reveals similarities and differences between the two approaches. Methods: MeSH terms assigned to 397.475 journal articles published in 2015. as well as their 4.632.992 cited references. were retrieved from Web of Science and MEDLINE databases. respectively. which formed over 7 million MeSH co-assignments and nearly 18 million direct citation pairs. We generated six network visualizations of biomedical science at three levels using Gephi software based on these MeSH co-assignments and citation pairs. Results: The MeSH co-assignment map contained more nodes and edges. as MeSH co-assignments cover all medical topics discussed in articles. By contrast. the MeSH citation map contained fewer but larger nodes and wider edges. as citation links indicate connections to two similar medical topics. Conclusion: These two types of maps emphasize different aspects of biomedical sciences. with MeSH co-assignment maps focusing on the relationship between topics in different categories and MeSH direct citation maps providing insights into relationships between topics in the same or similar category.   2021.

107,The article studies special aspects of management of higher education institutions through the use of correlation analysis. There were twelve universities of Moscow and Moscow region that were included into selection. According to results of the conducted research the authors of article have come to the following conclusions. Universities' administrations are prone to compensate the defects of management. decrease of students' number and. as consequence. revenue contractions by laying off the teaching personnel. In this vein. teachers are the most voidable group in a system of higher education management. Meantime. the number of students does not influence the real financial revenue of higher education teaching personnel. which may increase only with the growth of teaching load. The same situation is with publication activity of academic staff. It seems. that universities' administration either does not use large-scale financial incentives to increase the publication activity of academic teaching personnel in journals from the information-analytical systems of scientific citation Web of Science and Scopus. or these incentives are not comparable with the labor and other costs of publishing scientific articles in these bases. which does not lead to the expected actions on the part of the faculty.In both cases. it is not fair to put the whole responsibility on managerial incompetence of higher institutions. The reasons. which lead to this situation. might be weak managemental independence. relatively lean funds allocated for research. which are most likely concentrated in leading universities.

108,This paper investigates the dynamics of student enrolment in the Syrian private higher education sector. The paper adopts a system dynamics approach. to construct suitable simulation models that could be used to examine the complex and dynamic interactions between student flows. staff ratios and investments in plant and facilities. The study involved interviews with key university personnel. focus groups with university staff. a survey of student perceptions and personal observations of key departments at the university selected for the study. Further interviews were held with members of staff of all the other private universities in Syria. The simulation model developed in this study has provided insightful and meaningful exploration of data whose practical applicability is not necessarily restricted to the Syrian university. but broadly encompasses all educational sectors. whether private or public. The model designed in this research is a decision support system. one that is a flexible tool to design measures that might help to improve student enrolments. University management can use the simulation model to create different future scenarios. involving changes in student numbers. staff?student ratios or investment in plant and facilities.   2017.   2017 Society for Research into Higher Education.
109,Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the extent to which TQM has influenced the legal system in Australia. an area seldom investigated in the quality or legal literature. Design/methodology/approach: Documentary and policy analysis of legislation. rules and rulemaking documentation based on a partial application of historical-policy analysis (HPA). Textual analysis was based on Dean and Bowen's (1994) definition of TQM and Vinni's (2007) review of new public management and Swiss (1992) ?reformed TQM? concepts. Findings: Australia's Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency Act of 2011 and supporting legal documents such as Guidance Notes include language reflective of TQM principles. providing evidence that present-day administrative law schemes include TQM practices and tools to undergird procedures of regulatory expectations (sometimes in the form of standards). monitoring and general operations. Oftentimes. it is the supporting legal documentation where TQM practices are found and operationalized. Research limitations/implications: This is a proof-of-concept research study to determine the feasibility to identify TQM concepts within the existing language of legal statutes and supporting regulatory documentation. As such this study worked out the preliminary research challenges in performing this type of analysis. Practical implications: Understanding TQM's impact on legal systems expands the system's perspective of organizations that do not always factor in the influence government policy has on organizational behaviours and outlooks. More specifically. understanding TQM's influence sheds insight on regulatory requirements imposed on a sector and the normative aspects of regulatory compliance that impact the operations and strategic planning of organizations. Social implications: The article provides an example of how legal administrative rulemaking influences organizational operational and strategic activities to remain viable in the organization's business or industrial sector. Originality/value: There are few research papers or literature reviews pertaining to the subject of TQM concepts embedded in laws and regulations. most of which date from the 1980s through early 2000s.   2020.

110,Agricultural decision support tools (DSTs) with weather or climate information can provide useful information to help stakeholders make operational farming decisions and adapt to increasingly variable weather or climate in the context of climate change. However. many of these DSTs are still not fully utilized. Understanding the use of DSTs can help identify strategies to promote their usage to more end-users. This study surveyed farmers (n = 2.633) and advisors (n = 2.719) across 12 states in the Midwest to draw comparisons on their usage of DSTs and factors influencing the usage. The advisors are more likely to take advantage of free and publicly available sources than farmers. Advisors are also more likely to agree on the usefulness of DSTs. feel social pressure to use DSTs. be concerned and perceive risks from variable weather. believe in climate change. and show positive attitudes towards climate change adaptation than farmers. Concerns about weather or climate. descriptive social norms. greater farm size. and general propensity to adopt a new technology are positively associated with higher adoption rate of DSTs for both farmers and advisors. Higher level of perceived behavioral control to deal with weather-related risks. injunctive social norms. gender (male). and age are positively associated with higher adoption rate of DSTs for only advisors. Positive adaptation attitude towards climate change and higher education level are positively associated with higher adoption rate of DSTs for only farmers. Unlike advisors. age is negatively associated with higher adoption rate of DSTs for farmers. Implications of our findings include DST educators leveraging social networks and reinforcing social norms to promote usage among current non-users. building up both farmers' and advisors? confidence and knowledge in using DSTs. understanding the role of advisors as ?change agents? to promote DST usage among farmers. and connecting networks of ?innovators? and ?early adopters.? With more and more DSTs developed. future scholarship can draw upon our findings to understand how to encourage DSTs adoption among current non-users and extend to other regions.   2020 Elsevier Ltd
111,Purpose. The study aims to demonstrate the importance of artificial intelligence (AI) and examples of tools based on it in the process of enhancing (building. measuring. and managing) customer engagement (CE) in social media in the higher education industry. CE is one of the current essential non-financial indicators of company performance in Digital Marketing strategy. The article presents a decision support system (DSS) based on social media engagement management with the use of AI-based tools in a higher education industry case study. Methodology. The study was based on an analysis of the literature on AI in conjunction with CE. the results of research - 2022 Social Media Industry Benchmark - prepared by Rival IQ. and qualitative research (in-depth interviews with experts) at selected universities in Poland. At a later stage. the interviews were transcribed. thematically analyzed. and open coding with NVivo was performed. Findings. The conducted study was of an introductory and exploratory nature. It recognises the significant role of AI in enhancing CE in social media. At the same time. examples of AI-based tools that can be used for this have been indicated. It was unequivocally stated that by implementing AI in marketing. universities can act more effectively and consequently enhance their non-financial performance. For them. it is a system that assists decision-making in the field of social media engagement management. Research limitations. Due to its preliminary nature. the study used secondary sources (Rival IQ Report 2022) and individual in-depth interviews with three managers of promotion/marketing departments. which does not give a complete picture of the situation under analysis. However. it is the first step in research on this subject that is to be continued. The theoretical contribution. The conducted research demonstrated the role of AI in enhancing customer engagement in social media in higher education while at the same time showing its auxiliary role in the decision-making process. Practical implications. Specific tools such as Sprout Social or Rival IQ were identified that. when applied in universities. can measure the engagement rate and effective CE management in social media used by the university.   2022 The Authors.

112,"Alignment with the European Higher Education Area (EHEA) has involved changes in teaching methodology and in the learning process. which have led to a change in student workload. The main aim of this study is to evaluate and compare the perception of the workload of undergraduate and graduate psychology students and to analyse the nature of the changes produced by this adaptation. The sample comprised 845 students (497 readings for the licentiate's degree and 348 for the bachelor's degree). To measure perceived workload. the NASA-TLX scale was used. This evaluates the following dimensions: mental demand. physical demand. temporal demand. performance. and frustration/dissatisfaction, these variables were evaluated for the following academic activities: attending theoretical classes. attending practical classes. conducting group work outside the classroom. searching for material and bibliography. studying and personal work. attending tutorials. and other activities (seminars. conferences. etc.). The results show a significant increase in the perceived load of attendance in practical classes. in the performance of group work outside the classroom and in total perceived workload for bachelor's degree students. It is concluded that adjusting to the EHEA has involved an increase in perceived workload for students. This points to a need to work in the classroom on developing interpersonal skills and planning and organization of teamwork. as well as greater coordination between teachers in the evaluation systems.   2019 Universidad Internacional de la Rioja."
113,Although many efforts are being made to provide educators with dashboards and tools to understand student behaviors within specific technological environments (learning analytics). there is a lack of work in supporting educators in making data-informed design decisions when designing a blended course and planning learning activities. In this paper. we introduce concept-level design analytics. a knowledge-based visualization. which uncovers facets of the learning activities that are being authored. The visualization is integrated into a (blended) learning design authoring tool. edCrumble. This new approach is explored in the context of a higher education programming course. where teaching assistants design labs and home practice sessions with online smart learning content on a weekly basis. We performed a within-subjects user study to compare the use of the design tool both with and without the visualization. We studied the differences in terms of cognitive load. design outcomes and user actions within the system to compare both conditions to the objective of evaluating the impact of using design analytics during the decision-making phase of course design.   2019.

114,The Degree Final Project (DFP) is considered the most relevant learning experience of an academic program. In fact. it is even used as an indicator of the degree?s quality. Given its relevance. this study aims to analyse Spanish public and private university approaches to the DFP for Degree in Early Childhood Education Teachers and / or Primary Education Teachers. Degree in Social Education and Degree in Pedagogy. We have conducted a content analysis of the 173 DFP?s teaching guides in the degrees of education at Spanish universities. Moreover. a focus group has been held in which seven experts in management and / or research in DFP have participated. Findings show significant differences between public and private universities in some aspects such as the academic credit load. the assessable items. as well as the agents that evaluate the DFP. Experts in the focus group consider that the DFP should be a tool that shows whether knowledge and competences have been acquired during the degree course. Results suggest the need to plan the DFP?s curriculum in a flexible way. adapting the academic credit load to the demands of the task required. as well as diversifying the type of DFP so that students choose which one to do. We conclude that it is necessary to agree on the general guidelines of the tutorial work. to take a formative assessment model that provides valuable feedback to the students and to take the professional profile as a reference for the DFP in order to foster facilitative learning of performance in the work context.   2021.

115,The purpose of this study is to analyse the caring behavioural education model that is influenced jointly by the value of personality and expertise courses as learning outcomes with a single mediation or a combination of student attitudes about caring. subjective norms of students and perceptions of caring behaviour of nursing students. This study uses a quantitative research approach with Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) analysis techniques using Lisrel software. The study was conducted on 120 students of the third level of the Study Program in DIII Nursing Stikes Hang Tuah. Surabaya who are undergoing the final practice in the form of a case study at Hospital Dr Ramelan. Surabaya. The results showed that the educational model of student caring behaviour is influenced jointly by knowledge in the form of personality and skills courses in the form of expertise courses through a combination of mediation together with the direct influence of student attitudes about caring. the direct influence of student subjective norms and the effect of indirect perception control student caring behaviour. The results of the research model are fit. which includes both. Implications: the results of the study found the concept that caring behaviour education for nursing students needs to be developed based on the principles of knowing moral integrity. moral feeling. and moral action through various learning approaches. Students need to be assigned assignments for study visits or internships at a hospital. according to the time available. as part of the lecture system. to gain more knowledge and skills. It is also necessary for leaders or related institutions to develop caring behavioural learning modules in health services in hospitals.   2020 Primrose Hall Publishing Group.
116,The topicality of the problem of relations between the intelligentsia and the authorities is due to the objective processes in modern education and the reforms that are constantly taking place in higher education. The purpose of this study is to clarify the relationship of the scientific and pedagogical intelligentsia with the authorities. The intelligentsia of Soviet Ukraine was dependent on the authorities because the state was the monopoly employer. Control over the scientific and pedagogical intelligentsia and people of creative professions took place through membership in the Communist Party. creative unions. and their further involvement in responsible projects. Due to their publicity the activities of the teaching staff largely depended on loyalty to the Communist Party. The high attention of the authorities to the workers of higher education is also explained by the fact that it was they who actually were the creators of the skilled personnel of almost the entire Soviet intelligentsia. In a state of a totalitarian type the social and professional perspective of each individual was possible only in conditions of political loyalty. The political consciousness of teachers was assessed by the volume of loyal references to the Communist Party and Soviet power in lectures. reports and publications. The teachers' lectures were stenographed twice a year and tested for loyalty. Also important was the public function of lecturing on current events for the general population in residential areas. houses of culture. etc. In fact. it was a load the rejection of which would be considered as anti-Sovietism. Nevertheless. in these harsh and regulated conditions. in a narrow circle of communication with students. in families. etc. an illegal mass critical view of the intelligentsia on the political system was born. which. after 25 years. grew into an open confrontation and the victory of democracy.   2022 Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies.

117,The study aims to promote the knowledge creation activities for the under developing countries like Ethiopia. which is the need of the hour. Faculty members' participation in research not only helps in improving the quality of faculty members but also improves the quality of the institute. In this paper. we use survey data from Wollega University to understand the factors hindering the research participation decision of faculty members at the university level. This survey tries to analyse the determinants of participation of academic staff in Wollega University. The logit model was used for analysing the data. We conclude that availability of publication incentives. work experience. speed of internet. accessibility to research funds and colleague collaboration on research participation all enhance the probability of academic staff's research participation while teaching load is negatively related to the probability of academic staff's research participation in the study area.

118,Automated assessment and feedback of computer programming tasks can be a significant asset in computer science education. Web based systems providing such capabilities are designed to apply techniques ranging from static analysis of program correctness. to testing-based evaluation. and often can have application in frameworks supporting competitive programming. Here we report on the 2TSW system. which uses the testing-based approach in a gamified web-based environment. In 2TSWa learner can access a list of assignments. submit solutions and have such solutions tested and graded. The quality of the solutions contributes to the contents of the student's profile. showing experience points. medals gained for assignments. assignment categories badges. and an appropriate overall status badge. The personal profile allows the student to monitor her/his proceedings. The gamified structure of the system. together with the provision of real-time automated assessment. offers the opportunity for an increasing level of students' personal engagement and motivation. We describe the system. and provide the reader with the results of a field experimentation. conducted in a first-year computer programming course. bachelor in Computer Engineering. The data analysis of a questionnaire allows to conclude that the system was very welcome. and that the students appreciated the general gamified experience and the usefulness of the system. The data also allow to conclude that the students' engagement was high and that the learners appear to be open to the possibility of using again 2TSW and any other web-based system supporting assessment of complex tasks. also on subject matters different than Computer Programming.   2019 IEEE.
119,Digital transformation in the global higher education industry determines the future roadmap to a sustainable education management strategy. This research paper aims to develop a qualitative model that advocates how digital transformation as a propelling force could be used to build competitive advantages for universities. Building competitive advantage is a relative. evolving. and important concept in strategy formulation. In recent years. specifically in the education industry. the notion of building competitive advantage is challenged by global phenomena such as digital transformation globalization. information exchange. digitization and social media in most of the global industries. These phenomena have collectively made the process of building competitive advantage rapidly changing. short-term and contextual. These findings aid the evolution of strategic management practices in universities by providing empirical insights in determining the impactful changes and their connection to evolutionary learning. It also stresses the importance of using the developed model as a decision support system to generate. regulate and retain student experience and expectations. This research paper provides first-hand insight into the impactful changes affecting universities? vision and how they can turn these changes to their advantages and set a road map to design-develop models to integrate and regulate these essential changes in their strategies using evolution learning mechanism and digital transformation strategy.   2021.

120,Sriwijaya State Polytechnic is one of the state vocational universities in Indonesia which plays an important role in producing alumni with adequate expertise. Efforts are being made to achieve this goal through increasing the competence of lecturers in the Higher Education environment. The program is realized by carrying out lecturer strengthening activities which are divided into 5 activities. namely 1) assignment research. 2) assignment service. 3) workshops and training. 4) competency certification. and 5) industrial internship. This study aims to build a model group decision support system (GDSS) for management in universities to determine lecturers who will participate in lecturer strengthening activities. The method used is a combination of Multifactor Evaluation Process (MFEP) and Borda. The MFEP method is used to generate recommendations from each decision maker independently. while the Borda method is used to perform aggregation and final ranking of the recommended alternatives. In this built GDSS model. there are 8 criteria and 20 alternatives involved in testing the proposed model. The results of this study can be used by management in universities in group decision making. and as a research model in group decision support systems.   2021 Little Lion Scientific.
121,This paper aims to propose a quality assessment model for higher education institutions in the technical-technological field and a system for decision support and optimal management strategies for quality improvement. Obtaining research results is based on surveying stakeholders in higher education and obtaining quantitative data regarding key performance indices. Quantitative data and the genetic algorithm method are applied to determine optimal management strategies for quality improvement. Quality in the higher education sector is among the current issues in the academic community. By monitoring and researching the higher education field and analysing the literature and the current situation in the system of higher education in developing countries. it can be concluded that there is no single way to assess the quality of higher education institutions. This knowledge was a good starting point for the research presented in this paper. Accordingly. the findings include developing a system for quality assessment and the ranking of higher education institutions. Additionally. evaluating the relevance of key performance indicators of higher education institutions differs from different stakeholder perspectives. However. it is possible to develop a system for decision support and the selection of the optimal strategy for improving the performance of study programs and higher education institutions with regard to quality. The practical implications include defining a decision support system that enables the adoption of optimal decisions by the management teams of higher education institutions to improve study programs and the performance of the higher education institutions. The presented system may enable the benchmarking. simulation. and verification of different scenarios for improving the quality and performance of higher education institutions. In this paper. the authors analysed the characteristics. benefits. and drawbacks of different ranking systems to develop and introduce a novel ranking system that suggests weights for the ranking criteria and different perspectives regarding new digital age requirements. The model was tested. and the results are presented to demonstrate the advantages of the developed model. The originality of the research lies in the presented novel model that can be made available to government institutions and serve as a basis for the overall ranking and evaluation of higher education institutions. with the possibility of developing a performance-based funding system. Additionally. other stakeholders can gain an insight into the performance of an institution in relation to their needs and goals.   2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI. Basel. Switzerland.

123,Background: Molecular taxonomic assignments in oral microbial communities have been made using probe-matching approaches. but never compared to those obtained by more readily accepted tree-based approaches. Objective:  To compare community composition profiles obtained from a probe-matching approach (HOMINGS) to those from a closed-ended tree-based approach (QIIME using the eHOMD database). Design:  HOMINGS and QIIME were used for parallel analysis of ten mock community samples. and of 119 supragingival plaque samples from ecologically unique sites (sound tooth surfaces in healthy subjects. sound tooth surfaces in patients with primary Sj?gren?s Syndrome. and carious lesions in Sj?gren?s Syndrome patients). Linear discriminant analysis Effective Size (LEfSe) was used to identify discriminating taxa among the natural plaque samples. Results: Community composition profiles of all samples were congruent between the two analysis aproaches. Alpha and beta diversity of the natural plaque communities were likewise similar. Communities from pSS patients and those from individuals with normal salivary flow differed in alpha and beta diversity. Both classification approaches yielded differences in composition predicted for samples from these subject cohorts. and discriminating taxa were similar between approaches. Conclusions: A direct comparison demonstrates that HOMINGS is largely equivalent to the tree-based approach as implemented here.  .

125,Studies have provided evidence that Interprofessional Education (IPE) can improve learners' attitudes. knowledge. skills. behaviors. and competency. Traditionally. IPE is commonly seen in the healthcare professional training in tertiary education. Aging is a global issue that requires more than just a single healthcare sector. It requires interdisciplinary collaboration and understanding to tackle the issues. Therefore. IPE is essential for nurturing university students to tackle the ever-changing global challenges. In addition. different hurdles can hinder IPE development. To have a better understanding of the feasibility. acceptance. and educational value of IPE in Hong Kong. we conducted a cross-sectional quantitative study. We invited teachers and students from a Hong Kong university to fill in an online survey that evaluated their understanding and participation in IPE. their attitude toward IPE. and the barriers to developing IPE from March to June 2020. Among the 37 academic staff and 572 students who completed the survey. 20 (54.1{\%}) teachers and 422 (73.8{\%}) students had never heard of IPE before. and 26 (70.3{\%}) teachers and 510 (89.2{\%}) students had never participated in any IPE activities. Major barriers reported by teachers included an increase in teaching load (72.9{\%}). lack of administrative support (72.9{\%}). lack of financial support and limited budget (67.5{\%}). difficulty to make logistic arrangements (64.8{\%}). and problems with academic schedules and calendars (62.1{\%}). The survey findings revealed that despite the positive attitude of university teachers and students toward IPE. barriers that could hinder the development of IPE included heavy teaching and administrative load and logistic arrangement for classroom arrangement and academic scheduling involving multiple faculties.

127,"BackgroundFollowing the COVID-19 pandemic. distance education (DE) replaced traditional ""face-to-face"" teaching and has become the main method of teaching. The aim of this study was to 1) evaluate the impact of DE by teachers in our department during the second semester of the 2019-20 academic year following the March-May 2020 Italian national lockdown and 2) evaluate the relationship between DE and the emotional well-being of teachers during the period of home confinement.MethodsNinety-seven university teachers (51.5{\%} women, most represented age group 60-69years range. 40.2{\%}) responded to an anonymous online cross-sectional survey between July 15 - September 30. 2020. on the advantages and disadvantages of DE. developed by one online teacher focus group. The emotional conditions were assessed by a short version of the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). The internal consistency reliability survey and the 10-item BDI-II were measured by Cronbach's alpha. A correlation analysis (r-Pearson) was conducted between the overall evaluation of the experience of DE and the variables included in the study.ResultsTeachers reported difficulties in technical aspects. and in psychological factors. as the discomfort of ""speaking in the void"" (64.7{\%}). The absence of ""face-to-face"" eye contact with the students was complained by 81{\%} of teachers.Significant impairments in sleep patterns and loss of energy were reported. with female teachers having greater difficulty concentrating than their male colleagues.

130,Bulacan State University (BulSU) is a state funded higher education institution in the Philippines located in the City of Malolos in Bulacan. It is observed that on the average. electricity consumption the University is increasing at a rate of 32.5% per annum. It is also noted that the University is lacking in Energy Management System (EnMS) which may help the University in reducing its annual energy consumption. The goal of this study is to design a multiple criteria decision support system in establishing EnMS based on ISO 50001 standards for the College of Engineering building of BulSU which may serve as archetype reference for the University-wide implementation of EnMS. The methodology is divided into five phases. Phase 1 is energy audit at the building under the study. The total energy audited is 59.443 kWh. 65% of which is due to air-conditioning system of the building followed by laboratory and office equipment (16%) and lighting (14%). Phase 2 is the design of EnMS which reveals the annual cost of implementing the system. Phase 3 simulates the reduction in energy when EnMS is implemented. Study reveals a decrease of 23.38% in energy use after five years implementation of the system. Phase 4 performs cost-benefit analysis using net present value (NPV) method and return of investment (ROI) method. NPV is at least Php 4 Million and ROI is found to be 4.2 years. Phase 5 identifies the different criteria that will help the University administration in their decision to support the implementation of the proposed EnMS. The proposed EnMS was presented to the top officials of the University and was graded using the multi-criteria decision support system as beneficial.   2019 IEEE.

133,We have designed an anti-plagiarism software to detect plagiarism in students? assignments. especially written assignments. homework. and research reports. which will hereinafter be collectively referred to as student work. We used our university network to gather student work to detect plagiarism. To collect data. we used a domain name system to store the student work data based on the respective location. time. and the subject on which each student was assigned work. Once the student work data were collected. they were sent to an extraction module to remove unwanted data. The remaining data were then fed to a similarity index module. which produced similarity values based on comparisons between the collected data and the student work. This module uses mathematical equations that are built using semantic and syntactic similarity reports. Furthermore. in this study. we recommended procedures that can be applied to avoid plagiarism using the programming approach. This approach can raise awareness of plagiarism among students and encourage them to generate innovative ideas instead of plagiarizing. To attract faculty members to use the software. promotional materials can be customized based on the actual control factors that directly affect their adoption of the software. For example. the campaign should provide information highlighting the ease of implementation of the software for senior faculty members.   2020 Informa UK Limited. trading as Taylor & Francis Group.
134,The UPM Master in Space Systems (MUSE) is a two-year graduate program focused on space systems technology. The program is largely project-based. with the UPMSat-2 satellite mission as a general framework to which the various course subjects are applied. The course on Data Housekeeping deals with the hardware and software aspects of the on-board computer systems in charge of data acquisition. monitoring and control within a spacecraft. with special reference to UPMSat-2. as well as the command and supervision functions of the associated ground segment. Since the real hardware used on the satellite is expensive and thus not amenable to use in laboratory work. except in very limited situations. a simplified engineering model of it has been developed by the authors. The model is based on a cheap. reduced size microcomputer board kit that can be easily acquired and taken home by the students in order to carry out the laboratory assignments and supplementary work as needed. The hardware and software components of the laboratory kit. its use in the course. and its impact on the students performance. are described in the paper.   2020 Elsevier B.V.. All rights reserved.
135,This Innovative Practice Full Paper notes that recent research has indicated that large numbers of college and university students make limited use of their class textbooks. This is particularly true in terms of assigned readings - whether they are required for the course or not. Students are knowingly depriving themselves of an important means of learning. While the falling use of textbooks among students is concerning. it should be especially so because of the ongoing pandemic. The pandemic has forced much of the secondary educational experience online. limiting forms of in-person lectures and group activities. and severely restricting or rendering impossible hands-on assignments such as labs and projects. It is clear that the current environment students find themselves in is not optimized for learning. In an attempt to increase student understanding of course material. an online. interactive textbook was created using the software platform Top Hat The book is in its first edition. and is for use with the university's engineering course Statics and Mechanics of Materials. It was written and developed by a professor with years of teaching experience and course development. and by a student who had previously taken the course and has worked as a certified tutor for the university. The textbook employs pedagogies designed to increase student understanding of material. such as active learning. and is used in conjunction with a flipped classroom format. To facilitate this approach. the book has readings that are to be completed before lecture in preparation for various class activities. including group assignments and discussions and think-pair-share. Questions are embedded within the assigned readings for the students to check their understanding of the material. These questions provide instant feedback to the students. either informing them their answer was correct. or alerting them it was incorrect and giving hints to help solve the problem. As the textbook makes use of educational strategies known to improve student learning. it is desired to know if the book had a positive impact on their understanding of the course material. One method of evaluating the online text is to compare students' text use with their level of achievement in the course. Two factors related directly to text use were investigated: the number of questions in the textbook students answered correctly (Correctness) and the number of questions in the textbook answered in general (Participation). The students were categorized into three levels (low. medium. and high) based on their respective score for each variable and two. one-way between-subjects analysis of variance (ANOVA) were performed to determine if there existed a significant difference between student textbook usage (participation and correctness) and overall course grades. Post hoc testing was then performed to determine differences between the three groups. Both F-tests were significant. with significant differences found between the different groups for both correctness and participation. The largest difference occurred between the top and bottom thirds of the class with respect to question correctness. with the difference in mean final course grades being a full letter grade.   2021 IEEE.
136,Mobile edge computing has been an important supplement for traditional cloud computing architecture to offer low-delay computing services to mobile users. However. it is in general impossible for edge service providers to overdeploy so much edge resources to satisfy the rapidly increasing while diverse user demands. In this paper. we study a mobile edge computing system consisting of a service platform. cloudlets joining the system. and mobile users. In this study. we focus on a profit-driven perspective such that the service platform purchases computation resource from the resource-rich cloudlets and makes profit by processing tasks from user side. The design objective is to maximize the platform profit subject to budget constraint and stringent delay requirements for task processing. We formulate this problem as a mixed integer programming problem. Due to the NP-hardness of the problem. we design a logic based Benders decomposition algorithm as the offline solution. We further study the scenario where the task arrivals from user side and resource availability at the cloudlets are both stochastic and unknown in advance. We accordingly propose a Multi-Armed Bandit learning based resource purchasing and greedy task scheduling algorithm for the online scenario. Simulations results show the high performance of our proposed algorithms. PU  - IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC PI  - PISCATAWAY PA  - 445 HOES LANE. PISCATAWAY. NJ 08855-4141 USA
137,The genus Giardia includes several species distinguished by morphological. biological and molecular features. Currently. eight species within the genus are retained as valid. In Italy no identification of Giardia species other than Giardia duodenalis has been so far reported. Fecal samples were collected from two Gunther's Voles (Microtus guentheri) positive to Giardia cysts by microscopic investigation and immunofluorescence. The voles were born in Milan (Northern Italy) from two gravid females imported from the Netherlands and kept for sale in a pet shop in Varese (Northern Italy). Positive feces were subjected to a nested PCR to amplify a 18S rRNA fragment for molecular characterization. A phylogenetic analysis was conducted to compare the obtained sequence with those of all other Giardia species available in GenBank for the 18S locus. using the Maximum Likelihood (ML) method by R software. Sequence analyses unambiguously identified the isolates as belonging to G. microti. showing 99{\%} of identity with those of its isolates available in GenBank. A well-defined cluster. supported by significant bootstrap values and corresponding to the G. microti cluster. including sequences obtained from M. guentheri. was evidenced in the ML tree. confirming species assignment. The present finding represents the first report of G. microti from pet animals in Italy. PU  - ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD PI  - CLARE PA  - ELSEVIER HOUSE. BROOKVALE PLAZA. EAST PARK SHANNON. CO.

139,Background: Automated assignment of specific ontology concepts to mentions in text is a critical task in biomedical natural language processing. and the subject of many open shared tasks. Although the current state of the art involves the use of neural network language models as a post-processing step. the very large number of ontology classes to be recognized and the limited amount of gold-standard training data has impeded the creation of end-to-end systems based entirely on machine learning. Recently. Hailu et al. recast the concept recognition problem as a type of machine translation and demonstrated that sequence-to-sequence machine learning models have the potential to outperform multi-class classification approaches.Methods: We systematically characterize the factors that contribute to the accuracy and efficiency of several approaches to sequence-to-sequence machine learning through extensive studies of alternative methods and hyperparameter selections. We not only identify the best-performing systems and parameters across a wide variety of ontologies but also provide insights into the widely varying resource requirements and hyperparameter robustness of alternative approaches. Analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of such systems suggest promising avenues for future improvements as well as design choices that can increase computational efficiency with small costs in performance.Results: Bidirectional encoder representations from transformers for biomedical text mining (BioBERT) for span detection along with the open-source toolkit for neural machine translation (OpenNMT) for concept normalization achieve state-of-the-art performance for most ontologies annotated in the CRAFT Corpus. This approach uses substantially fewer computational resources. including hardware. memory. and time than several alternative approaches.Conclusions: Machine translation is a promising avenue for fully machine-learning-based concept recognition that achieves state-of-the-art results on the CRAFT Corpus. evaluated via a direct comparison to previous results from the 2019 CRAFT shared task. Experiments illuminating the reasons for the surprisingly good performance of sequence-to-sequence methods targeting ontology identifiers suggest that further progress may be possible by mapping to alternative target concept representations.

140,The current study intends to investigate teachers' beliefs about the issues encountered by writing teachers when they assess writing skills at the University of Algiers2. It also examines the factors which lie behind these challenges. Understanding the nature of the perceived challenges of assessing writing is very important to rethink the assessment practices of writing skills. Therefore. this study addresses the following research question: what are teachers' beliefs about the issues encountered when assessing students' writing skills? In this concern. the researcher adopted mixed method research to collect data by using a questionnaire and a semi-structured interview with ten teachers of writing selected randomly in the English department at the University of Algiers 2. Findings revealed that almost all teachers viewed the process of assessing writing as a very challenging task. Examples of the difficulties identified in this research include students' language problems. teachers' confusion between focusing on the content or the form. time pressure. overloaded classes. and lack of sufficient time to assess students' writing skills. Regarding the reasons behind these perceived challenges. teachers believed that the abovementioned issues stemmed from the lack of participation in a professional development program. low teaching load. and students' lack of intensive practice. This research provided a set of pedagogical implications to overcome these issues by calling for an emphasis on the importance of teachers' participation in a professional development program. reinforcement of teachers' training in the field of assessment. and the encouragement of students' intensive practice. and a sufficient teaching load.

Research methods: theoretical analysis of literature sources. documentary method. pedagogical observation. The theoretical analysis of literature sources and documentary method allowed to clarify the role. place and objectives of physical training in the professional activities of the instructors, the pedagogical observation was used in the analysis of the instructors' professional activities.CONCLUSION: Conclusions: It was found that the instructors' professional activities are influenced by many negative factors: low motor activity. length of working day and week. forced working position. stress. mental overload. stress. lack of time for physical training. These factors result in the appearance of excess weight. dysfunction of major body systems. reduced mental capacity. the emergence of various diseases and labour costs. All this has a negative impact on the learning process of cadets. The direction for improving the physical training of instructors is to increase the amount of general physical training. conducting training sessions with different orientations taking into account age. physical condition. teaching load of instructors. as well as class time. A high level of instructors' general physical fitness will allow to effectively perform training tasks, strengthen their health, maintain a high level of mental capacity for a long time, extend professional longevity."
142,"Background: Research on clinical trials that employ stem cells to treat children?s diseases is limited. The clinical trial registry database provides a unique window to us to get known about clinical trial researches with different statuses. However. few studies aimed to perform a comprehensive and thorough analysis of those registered trials in the aforementioned field based on ClinicalTrials.gov and the ICTRP portal site. Methods: Our study covered the clinical researches about stem cell therapy enrolling subjects aged under 18 years old registered on ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP before May 18. 2021. A cross-sectional study was implemented to comprehensively describe and analyze the included trials that met the criteria. Results were available on ClinicalTrials.gov. and publications related to the included trials were identified. All analyses were performed utilizing the SPSS 25.0 software. Results: Eventually. 202 clinical trials were included and evaluated. The participant number of trials tended to be small, 71.3% were enrolled < 50. And 93.5% of the subjects were without gender restrictions. Till May 2020. 112 trials had been preliminary completed. of which only 39 trials had published papers or uploaded results. Most (73.6%) of 186 interventional trials were in phase 1 and phase 2. where 131 (70.4%) trials were conducted without masking. and 26.3% trials were randomized, 55.4% trials were performed single group assignment. Of 16 observational trials. case-only/series took up 37.5%. Hematopoietic stem cells (37.1%) and mesenchymal stem cells (36.1%) were mostly employed. while umbilical cord blood (UCB)-derived cells (24.3%) and bone marrow (BM)-derived cells (20.8%) were the major sources. Conclusions: This study provided an overall picture of utilizing stem cells for treatment and management of childhood diseases. Since clinical trials in this area are insufficient in quantity and quality. there is an urgent need of larger. better-designed trials. Increased investment in clinical research of stem cell treatment products should be carried out to achieve the transformation of results as soon as possible. Moreover. it is important to optimize the management of the registration platform and shorten the time it takes for research results to be published.   2022. The Author(s)."
143,"Many metagenomic and environmental DNA studies require the taxonomic assignment of individual reads or sequences by aligning reads to a reference database. known as taxonomic binning. When a read aligns to more than one reference sequence. it is often classified based on sequence similarity. This step can assign reads to incorrect taxa. at a rate which depends both on the assignment algorithm and on underlying population genetic and database parameters. In particular. as we move towards using environmental DNA to study eukaryotic taxa subject to regular recombination. we must take into account issues concerning gene tree discordance. Though accuracy is often compared across algorithms using a fixed data set. the relative impact of these population genetic and database parameters on accuracy has not yet been quantified. Here. we develop both a theoretical and simulation framework in the simplified case of two reference species. and compute binning accuracy over a wide range of parameters. including sequence length. species?query divergence time. divergence times of the reference species. reference database completeness. sample age and effective population size. We consider two assignment methods and contextualize our results using parameters from a recent ancient environmental DNA study. comparing them to the commonly used discriminative k-mer-based method Clark (Current Biology. 31. 2021. 2728, BMC Genomics. 16. 2015. 1). Our results quantify the degradation in assignment accuracy as the samples diverge from their closest reference sequence. and with incompleteness of reference sequences. We also provide a framework in which others can compute expected accuracy for their particular method or parameter set.

144,Pedigrees have a long history in classical genetics. agronomics. evolutionary ecology. and ex situ captive breeding. Use of molecular techniques has expanded the variety of species for which pedigrees can be constructed. However. molecular pedigrees almost exclusively consider microsatellite loci. despite advances in high-throughput sequencing allowing development of genomic marker sets in nearly any organism. Here we generate a novel set of genomic SNPs derived from ddRAD sequencing in two populations of Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) and describe the diversity and differentiation between them. We then compare and contrast parentage assignment rates and accuracy in one population that has been the subject of long-term monitoring. Specifically. we consider pedigrees constructed using two sets of markers (microsatellites and SNPs). two pedigree construction software (CERVUS than Sequoia). as well as varying the groupings of candidate parents (either all individuals simultaneously. only individuals born before a focal year. or only individuals known to have survived to a focal year). ddRAD sequencing returned between 1568 and 3240 loci depending on whether both populations were considered simultaneously or individually. Parentage assignment rates were always higher using CERVUS than Sequoia. with the latter at times either not assigning parentage or creating ?inferred parents?. In all cases. ?polarizing? the datasets (e.g.. including year of birth) significantly improved assignments. This represents one of the first direct comparisons of pedigree construction using different markers in the same set of individuals. and the SNPs described here will be a resource for continued pedigree construction. and future research in Weddell seals.   2021.

145,"There is much that can be said about the competences of teachers and students needed to learn ICT and Multimedia in the Physics curriculum. The same applies to the teaching and assessment of those competences. Essentially. we are concerned with the goals of the education and the goals of the assessment. If we are concerned with the process of learning. formative assessment is appropriate. but if we want to know what has been learnt. summative assessment. using assignments with scoring instructions is better. In the Netherlands we have a context-based exam curriculum in which specific contexts have been prescribed since the 80s. So. schoolbooks. and as a result of that. most of the Physics lessons are context-based as well. Because of the principle ""test what you teach"". all exam questions are context-based too. With the help of ICT (data acquisition. video-analysis modelling. data-analysis or a simulation program) a lot of problems on several subjects are becoming more clear. Teachers and students can use software like COACH for doing measurements on film fragments and modelling the results. In the COMPEX project in the Netherlands. working over 3 levels corresponding to lower vocational. higher vocational and pre-university education. we used Applets. Excel. Data processing. video measurements and modeling in the tests. Because the students used the same software in their lessons. they had the skills to use the software. The questions and answers were on paper. The purpose of the project was to assess the skills competences they learned in the physics lessons.   Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd."
146,In the modern and digital society. the importance of software development is undeniable. Therefore. educating the next generation of software developers is crucial. However. learning how to program is challenging. and research on improving programming pedagogy is essential. Adding a laboratory component to programming courses can enhance the education. In this work. we first elicited requirements and guidelines for an introductory programming lab curriculum based on a literature review and feedback by instructors with years of experience. These included the use of (1) current and adequate tools. (2) collaborative learning environment. (3) formative assessment. (4) appropriate assignments for the target audience. (5) pedagogical innovations. and (6) to prepare students to be lifelong learners of the subject. Following. we present a curriculum for an introductory undergraduate programming lab based on the Raspberry Pi platform. It teaches students how to program following software development best practices and integrate software and hardware through a series of cyber-physical assignments. including developing a rover vehicle. We successfully piloted the curriculum with 30 students. and we present the highly positive feedback provided by them. Although the course was based on the C programming language. the underlying foundation on programming principles will allow students to apply the concepts in any language. Furthermore. this curriculum is not intended to be a one-size-fits-all approach to programming education. However. it can be a strong starting point for readers to tailor it to fit their audience. school needs. and student learning outcomes.   2022.

147,In this study we investigate college instructors' use of practices that facilitate interactions in online college courses. We begin by drawing on several strands of literature to offer a person-purpose interaction framework with two dimensions ? one regarding the entities involved in the interaction (instructor. student. content) and the other regarding the pedagogical goal of the interaction (academic. social. managerial) ? that result in six sub-domains of practices. Subsequently. we examine the frequency of. and factors associated with instructors' use of these six domains. using survey data collected from online college instructors (N = 126) from a large community college. The results show that instructors using more interaction-oriented practices consistently have greater employment stability and teaching load. greater self-efficacy for using learning management systems. and greater perceived benefits of online learning for students. The findings have several implications for future research examining pedagogical behavior. as well as the design of professional development activities aimed at enhancing the use of effective online instructional practices among college instructors.   2022 Elsevier Ltd

149,Research on academic expatriation has rarely investigated the drivers of academic performance in a foreign cultural environment. This study focuses on research productivity as a crucial facet of performance and integral part of academic jobs. Drawing from the job demands-resources model. we position perceived organizational support and the number of doctoral students supervised as resources and teaching and service load as demands of self-initiated expatriate (SIE) academics' jobs. Most importantly. we suggest that being cross-culturally adjusted is a vital personal resource living and working in a foreign country and that cross-cultural adjustment moderates the effects of demands and resources. The analysis of combined survey and publication data from 208 SIE academics in natural sciences indicates that the number of doctoral students supervised increases research productivity. while teaching load reduces it. Moreover. findings show that cross-cultural adjustment amplifies the effects of demands and resources. The implications of these findings are discussed.   2021 The Authors.

A questionnaire was employed to collect quantitative data from 612 Chinese English lecturers. The findings suggest that the lecturers had a relatively low self-identification as researchers and that all the independent variables had significant influences on their self-identification as researchers. The findings have the following implications. Firstly. colleges can encourage female. elderly. and non-publishing lecturers to do research by offering more incentives and research training. Secondly. colleges can implement favorable policies to encourage lecturers to pursue a doctoral degree. Thirdly. colleges can consider reducing the teaching load of the lecturers who wish to devote more time to research.   2022 Conscientia Beam. All Rights Reserved.
151,"Academic institutions are distinguished entities that perform pivotal functions to promote education and research. Faculty are involved in these aspects by contributing their best efforts to achieve goals. Thus. they are the most important organizational resources. The study aimed to investigate the quality of work life of state university faculty. Moreover. it intended to contribute new knowledge by identifying its influence on commitment and performance using Explanatory Sequential Mixed Methods. There are studies on quality of work life (QWL) in higher academic institutions with different components. However. this will be the first in education using the thirteen (13) factors of QWL of the 21st century. There is a sample of two hundred fifteen (n = 215) respondents and twenty participants from the state university in the province of Rizal. Philippines. Numerical data were treated with mean and Pearson?s r. while thematization is used to analyze qualitative data. Rewards and recognition have been commendable (M = 4.37), however. sustainable safety and health programs are aspired (M = 3.38). People feel empowered. but the excessive number of teaching loads was noticed. and the incentivization of those with the additional designation. The study found influence of quality of work life on commitment (r = .583. p < .01). QWL is considered multi-faceted. and evidently. many elements do not directly influence performance. having a very weak positive correlation (r = .079. p < .01). These results are deemed significant to continuously improve the welfare of employees. Hence. commitment and performance will be intensified.   Analyn Inarda. 2022."
152,Achieving the Saudi Kingdom?s vision 2030 in the higher education sector requires higher education institutions to make a significant simultaneous change in their current practices. This encompasses the transitioning of government-funded educational institutions to be financially independent. Therefore. a prompt. agile transition is required while maintaining a positive socioeconomic impact. entrepreneurship and innovation. and high-quality education. This necessitates the transition to lean processes and the review of current practices. One of the most vital processes in educational institutions is student admission/enrollment capacity planning. This study puts forward a capacity planning decision support system (DSS)-based framework for university student enrollment. The framework was applied to the case of KAU. where current practice and challenges are presented. and from which data were collected. A top-down/bottom-up approach was followed and applied using the goal programming technique and a developed mathematical model. respectively. Results show that the proposed framework effectively affects student admission/enrollment capacity planning on strategic and operational levels. Moreover. it can be used in other planning aspects of higher education in universities. such as human resources planning. teaching load planning. faculty-to-student ratios. accreditation. quality requirements. lab capacity planning. equipment/teaching aids procurement. and financial planning. to mention a few. The implications of this study include assisting decision-makers in higher education institutions in matching their admission/enrollment capacity of student numbers between the macro-strategic and the micro-operational level.   2022 by the authors.

153,This paper studies the usage of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a computerized decision aid in the field of higher education for the selection of candidates to an MBA program of a Business School from a large pool of candidates. The paper brings out as to how AI as a decision aid tool can improve the speed and quality of the selection of candidates for a postgraduate program in Business Management by simplifying the processes. Usage of AI in the admission process to a Business School has been a pioneering effort and this paper captures this process and its benefits uniquely since there is no research available to capture the usage of AI in candidate selection. The paper compares the admission process of two years - in the year 2020 using the traditional approach and in the year 2021 using AI as a computerized decision-making aid. The results of this comparative study clearly demonstrate the superiority of AI as a computerized tool assisting in decision making for the selection of the candidates thereby leading to process improvement.   2022 IEEE.

In this context. it is necessary to design and develop applications that assist librarians. Taking this into consideration. we present in this work the evaluation oftools for extracting information from books in PDF format that could be used later as raw material for an automatic indexing system. To do this. we carried out a first evaluation offive software (PDFMiner.six. PDFAct. PDF-extract.

155,Education of veterinary students in radiological interpretation in veterinary schools in Germany. Austria and SwitzerlandIntroduction The teaching of radiological interpretation skills in human medicine has been criticized as being inadequate in view of the enormous impact of diagnostic imaging in daily clinical work. There are no data on the situation in veterinary medicine. We thus aimed 1. to assess the level and degree of education in radiology in German-speaking. veterinary schools and 2. to search current literature for procedural checklists.Materials and methods Veterinarians employed at the diagnostic imaging sections of the eight German speaking veterinary schools were asked by telephone interview or questionnaire for the number of staff and the teaching load in radiology. It included questions on the number of staff and the teaching load in radiology. Textbooks and scientific articles about veterinary and human radiology were scanned for structured aids to interpretation. A systemic procedure for the evaluation of radiological images was prepared.Results On average. 9.9 +/- 2.9 full-time equivalent positions were filled by professionals (veterinarians 5.7 +/- 2.1 and technicians 4.2 +/- 1.9) at the eight departments of veterinary radiology. Teaching of general and diagnostic radiology was offered in 67 +/- 26.1 teaching units. The number of mandatory and optional courses varied widely. A systematic approach to image interpretation is discussed in 40 of 73 reference books (54.8{\%}) and in eleven publications. A systematic step-by-step approach is offered in 19 publications.Conclusions Veterinarians graduated from german-speaking veterinary schools start their clinical work with highly variable theoretical skills and often inadequate clinical skills in diagnostic imaging. The current literature offers limited teaching aids as there are only few articles and checklists on systematic image interpretation methods.

The shortage of funds and new Possibilities of comparative evaluation based on empirical data lead to open forms of competition in which fairness of comparisons is not always guaranteed. With regard to educational science. specific problems arise because both the available resources and the teaching load at the individual sites may differ considerably.

159,"A good understanding of digital signal processing concepts is essential for students of geophysical engineering. electrical engineering. and image processing. This paper presents a computer-based training software. which uses signal processing libraries to perform a number of interesting seismic experiments. Each experiment is focused towards a specific concept and presents a parameters input interface. The results are instantly generated in the form of a graphical display. This facilitates the student to play with parameters and observe their effects on the output. Some selected experiments have been discussed along with their parameters input interfaces and sample outputs. Such experiments provide a better understand and visualization of various seismic concepts. Studies on student groups indicate that these experiments motivate students and expedite self-learning. thus reducing the teaching load. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals. Inc.

160,"BACKGROUND. Many nursing studies are conducted in the United States. Europe. and Australia. where only a fourth of the world's population resides. There is a need to promote nursing research in Asia to enhance the contextual relevance of their evidence-based nursing interventions. A first step toward this goal is to determine the perceived research capacity among nursing faculty in academic settings in the Philippines.METHODS. This study described the perceived research capacity among nursing faculty of the University of Santo Tomas-College of Nursing. Manila. Philippines. The study used a survey that contained four sections: subject demographics, knowledge and skill on research designs and research process, research involvement. services. and incentives, and factors affecting research involvement. Chi-square test of homogeneity and MANOVA analyzed the gathered data.RESULTS. Findings showed that the faculty perceived themselves as knowledgeable and skillful in conducting research. However. current teaching assignments hindered their capacity to conduct research. University-sponsored incentives and college-based research services had also remained underutilized despite their availability. Overall. heavy teaching load was the greatest hindrance to research endeavors.CONCLUSION.

161,"Background. As of October 1. 2003. a new government-initiated legislative basis for undergraduate medical education was initiated in Germany which resulted in substantial changes to the structure of the medical curriculum and in a heightened teaching load.Methods. The Medical Faculty of the University of Dresden established an interdisciplinary reform curriculum in 1998. Since then a hybrid model of traditional lectures. seminars. practical and problem-based learning courses has been implemented for all courses in undergraduate medical training (Dresdener Integrated Problem-based Learning: DIPOL{\&}REG,).Results. Exemplarily for all other DIPOL{\&}REG, courses. the 2003 evaluation results of the ""Emergency medicine - Injuries - Intensive care medicine"" are presented and show that the course was very well received by students and tutors. and that 95{\%} of the students passed the exams.Conclusions. The DIPOL{\&}REG, anesthesiology course conforms with the new German federal law. A continuous further evaluation is an essential part of quality control and is necessary for the further development of a new curriculum. PU  - SPRINGER PI  - NEW YORK PA  - 233 SPRING STREET.

162,The objective of this paper is to present the teaching strategies for meaningful learning of the undergraduate nursing degree from the EUI Gimbernat (Ascribed to UAB) that have been incorporated into a subject in the field of nursing care in the outpatient hospital emergency room. As well. it presents the results in relation to student learning and perception of satisfaction and usefulness.The experience has been developed over the 2012-2013 courses with the participation of 143 students from 1st year of the nursing degree program.The process starts with the previous independent work of students. who have to prepare the theoretical content and answer a questionnaire to determine their level of knowledge about the topics. At the start of the sessions the teacher is responsible for energizing the group to be the students themselves and share with one another the material studied and the doubts raised and resolved between them (Flipped Classroom). During the sessions they also work on the practical skills necessary to perform procedures.Later. the students. in pairs. are addressing the resolution of a simulated emergency situation. in which they have to implement the knowledge and other skills such as teamwork and leadership.This action is filmed and shown to the group for review and evaluation by specific items (Video Feedback).The process concludes with the completion of a written individual reflection that includes the learning process experienced since the beginning of the sessions.Results are obtained in two manners. in one way. the process of learning. and in another way. student satisfaction and the usefulness of the strategies used.The student learning process is assessed quantitatively through the resulting average grade of self and co- evaluation of the recording of the simulation and the reflection of individual learning.On the other hand we estimated the satisfaction that students have shown in the results in relation to the methodology and its perceived usefulness. through the analysis of the responses generated from an online survey.It is concluded that the achievement of the stated objectives regarding the implementation of these new teaching strategies. is highly satisfactory. both in reference to the dynamics of the sessions. as in the recording emergency simulations and the subsequent self-and co-evaluation.Although some limitations are objectified in the management of the audiovisual devices and the initial teaching load is high. it is demonstrated that once the sessions are organized. the teaching load drops significantly for future editions. allowing the consideration of some very interesting teaching strategies.

163,This study's goal was to examine the relationship between the personal capability beliefs of new elementary-level science teachers in Denmark and their teaching environments for their association with teaching success and science teacher retention. Results suggest that pre-service training can increase the self-efficacy of elementary teachers of science as they enter the profession. In addition. the higher the teacher's assessments of their teaching environments were. the greater the positive changes in their self-efficacy were from pre-service until the end of their first year of teaching. Importantly. there is a positive relationship between these changes in self-efficacy during the first year of teaching and whether teachers continue to teach science. This knowledge may help identify new teachers who are more likely to drop teaching science from their teaching load and therefore enable schools to provide the support needed to ensure the viability and retention of new science teachers. The study encourages those who have found that higher teaching self-efficacies are associated with greater success PU  - SPRINGER PI  - DORDRECHT PA  - PO BOX 17. 3300 AA DORDRECHT. NETHERLANDS

Sailing as a subject has been present in six of the universities that offered the bachelor's degree in Physical Activity (Licenciatura) and. with the new university degree and the new degrees that have appeared in the recent years. there are ten universities that include. at least. one subject in sailing nowadays. The majority of the subjects share topics with other sports and as they are offered few credits. the teaching load is quite limited. Despite the existence of many faculties with great access to sailing facilities. only a few of them decide to include sailing in their Curriculum.

165,"Of all teaching methods. one-to-one human tutoring is the most powerful method for promoting learning. To achieve this aim and reduce teaching load. researchers developed intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) to employ one-to-one tutoring (Aleven. McLaren. {\&} Sewall. 2009, Aleven. McLaren. Sewall. {\&} Koedinger. 2009, Anderson. Corbett. Koedinger. {\&} Pelletier. 1995, Anderson {\&} Reiser. 1985, Blessing. Gilbert.

However. most ITSs have restricted user interfaces. which confine reasoning strategies of students during problem solving. thus ignoring the fact that students could use dissimilar strategies to solve a given question. Furthermore. student learning problems could be diagnosed from the derivation of their answers. In order to interpret students' mathematical problem-solving behaviors. this study developed a Model-tracing Intelligent Tutor (MIT) to diagnose students' learning problems and provide learning feedback for individual students. A quasi-experiment was conducted in an elementary school to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. in which 124 fifth graders participated. The experimental results show that the model-tracing-based learning diagnosis system is significantly more helpful to the students in learning mathematics than the conventional web-based test in terms of learning achievements.

166,"This research initiative was motivated by a reflective analysis of the deficiencies observed during the teaching-learning process. It aims to provide effective and efficient solutions to minimize. or better yet. eliminate these problems. The primary deficiencies observed were: a procedural deficit in students' key competencies. suitability of computer tools utilized in the teaching-learning process. and teachers' excessive teaching load. To address the first issue. an educational socialization approach was adopted by means of practical learning experiences in professional contexts. This type of experience is intended to foster students' vocational motivation. which is considered crucial to motivating their commitment to learning. An eclectic methodology is proposed based on a combination of three didactic proposals: academic tutoring. programmed teaching. and modular learning. Each learning approach comprises three stages: introduction. development and results.Firstly. the various development stages of the Teaching Innovation Project are described (preliminary actions. design of activities. implementation and reengineering), then. the results obtained are outlined. And lastly. the conclusions are presented. which confirm some of the hypotheses: modular learning proved to be a flexible methodology capable of adapting to different learning environments. whereas an excessively large number of participants greatly complicated work groups' internal functioning.

167,"The purpose of this investigation was to identify College of Education (COE) faculty members' perceptions of motivators and barriers to grant writing at a public university in the South. to compare the university's COE faculty perceptions to previously published survey results of Colleges of Education at Research I institutions. and to compare tenured and non-tenured faculty's responses. The survey instrument was adapted. with permission. from the instrument reported by Boyer and Cockriel (1998) for administration online. Several significant motivators were identified for the faculty: opportunity to probe or research new information, personnel support such as graduate assistants and clerical help when proposals are funded, having travel money available for conferences, building my professional reputation as a capable researcher, personnel support such as graduate assistants and clerical help when preparing proposals, more flexibility in how time is allocated, and assistance in grant proposal preparation. One important barrier to grant writing was identified: inadequate support available to submit proposals in a timely manner. One significant difference (heavy teaching load) was identified between tenured and non-tenured faculty. Recommendations were suggested to increase the number of grant proposals written and submitted by faculty and to support the overall grant writing process at the institution.

168,"The importance of academics undertaking research and publishing their research results is emphasised by universities. Engagement in research is recognised as an effective means to increase a university's profile. This study applied a qualitative approach to explore affordances. barriers. and motivations towards the engagement in research experienced by academics at one of the leading universities in Vietnam. Nineteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with academics whose academic rank. discipline. qualification. age. and gender are different. A thematic analysis of the data discovered four institutional factors hindering the engagement in research of academics: financial support for research activities (affordance), teaching load (barrier), research collaboration (motivation), and research policy settings and practices (motivation). The findings revealed that a majority of the respondents were aware of the importance of research but their research productivity is still low because of problems related to such institutional factors. The findings are useful in assisting leaders of the investigated university to understand the research motivation of its academics as well as ascertain barriers to which academics are facing that can be overcome through intervention. Such understanding helps them to improve the policy for research across this university which is predicted to enhance the research productivity of all academics. PU  - ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS.

169,The topic of this paper reflects the real needs and stipulated priorities within foreign language teaching at the Faculty of Economics and Management of the Czech University of Life Sciences Prague. One of the priorities in the field of education is the reduction of the lecturer's direct teaching load. which is connected with the use of modern ICT technologies. e-learning courses for full-time forms of studies. for distance studies and for the centres of lifelong learning outside Prague. For the purposes of the research. the e-learning course was developed.The objective of the research was to find out students' opinion on e-learning depending on the frequencies of their responses and on their qualitative signs.Statistically significant differences in the responses to questions are supposed to be caused by the personal experience of the students. who took part in the e-learning course and who could better judge the questions. and on the other hand. by the lack of experience of those who did not take part in the course. Most students who took part in the course supported the inclusion of the e-learning course in the distance studies and thought that the studies through the e-learning method could be as effective as through the face-to-face method.

Two of the main challenges are to learn to regulate the highly complex classroom situations (Jones. 2006) and to regulate their own emotional resources (Chang. 2009). Accordingly. in the present study. we investigated changes in teacher candidates' classroom management knowledge as well as emotional exhaustion at the beginning of their teaching careers. We applied latent change models to a sample of 746 teacher candidates who were assessed twice during the German induction phase (the Referendariat). We found evidence for a significant increase in teacher candidates' classroom management knowledge during the induction phase. Emotional exhaustion increased during the first year and decreased during the second year of the induction phase. We also investigated between-person differences in the changes. Classroom management knowledge was predicted by the teacher candidates' cognitive personal characteristics (e.g.. cognitive abilities and willingness to reflect). whereas emotional exhaustion was predicted by noncognitive personal characteristics (e.g.. emotional stability) as well as variables related to the induction phase (e.g.. perceived mentoring quality and teaching load).

171,"The case for establishing a second medical school in Singapore is strong. Given the recent explosive advances in medicine and biology. Singapore has identified the life sciences as an area of great economic potential. and aspires to become a regional ""medical hub"" capable of achieving excellence in healthcare. medical education and biomedical research. The existing medical faculty at the National University of Singapore is currently taking in 230 students per year. creating a very heavy teaching load which. coupled with even heavier clinical duties. makes it extraordinarily difficult for staff members to derive professional satisfaction and to pursue research interests. Creating a second medical school will alleviate some of these problems. which have contributed in no small way to the exodus of experienced clinicians and teachers to the private sector. Perhaps more importantly. having a second medical school will permit direct comparisons of the relative merits of different approaches to medical education. healthcare. and administrative practices. This in turn should lead to improvements in all these areas. thereby creating working environments more likely to satisfy staff aspirations. improve medical education and enhance research.

172,Recent research indicated that students' ability to construct evidence-based explanations in classrooms through scientific inquiry is critical to successful science education. Structured argumentation support environments have been built and used in scientific discourse in the literature. To the best of our knowledge. no research work in the literature addressed the issue of automatically assessing the student's argumentation quality. and the teaching load of the teacher that used the online argumentation support environments is not alleviated. In this work. an intelligent argumentation assessment system based on machine learning techniques for computer supported cooperative learning is proposed. Learners' arguments on discussion board were examined by using argumentation element sequence to detect whether the learners address the expected discussion issues and to determine the argumentation skill level achieved by the learner. Learners are first assigned to heterogeneous groups based on their responses to the learning styles questionnaire given right before the beginning of learning activities on the e-learning platform. A feedback rule construction mechanism is used to issue feedback messages to the learners in case the argumentation assessment system detects that the learners go in a biased direction. The Moodle. an open source software e-learning platform. was used to establish the cooperative learning environment for this study. The experimental results exhibit that the proposed work is effective in classifying and improving student's argumentation level and assisting the students in learning the core concepts taught at a natural science course on the elementary school level.

173,Background: The use of electronic learning formats (e-learning) in medical education is reported mainly from individual specialty perspectives. In this study. we analyzed the implementation level of e-learning formats and the institutional support structures and strategies at an institutional level in a cluster of mid-European medical schools.Methods: A 49-item online questionnaire was send to 48 medical schools in Austria. Germany and Switzerland using SurveyMonkey (R). Data were collected between February and September of 2013 and analyzed using quantities. statistical and qualitative means.Results: The response rate was 71 {\%}. All schools had implemented e-learning. but mainly as an optional supplement to the curriculum. E-learning involved a wide range of formats across all disciplines. Online learning platforms were used by 97 {\%} of the schools. Full-time e-learning staff was employed by 50 {\%}. and these had a positive and significant effect on the presence of e-learning in the corresponding medical schools. In addition. 81 {\%} offered training programs and qualifications for their teachers and 76 {\%} awarded performance-oriented benefits. with 17 {\%} giving these for e-learning tasks. Realization of e-learning offers was rewarded by 33 {\%}. with 27 {\%} recognizing this as part of the teaching load. 97 {\%} would use curriculum-compatible e-learning tools produced by other faculties.Conclusions: While all participating medical schools used e-learning concepts. this survey revealed also a reasonable support by institutional infrastructure and the importance of staff for the implementation level of e-learning offerings. However. data showed some potential for increasing tangible incentives to motivate teachers to engage in further use of e-learning. Furthermore. the use of individual tools and the distribution of e-learning presentations in various disciplines were quite inhomogeneous. The willingness of the medical schools to cooperate should be capitalized for the future. especially concerning the provision of e-learning tools and concepts.

174,"This paper presents a design for a cutting-edge English program in which elementary school learners of English as a foreign language in Taiwan had lively interactions with a teaching assistant robot. Three dimensions involved in the design included (1) a pleasant and interactive classroom environment as the learning context. (2) a teaching assistant robot designed and built by the researchers as instructional technology (instructional tool/medium). and (3) the need for improved motivation and learning outcomes and positive learning experiences of the students as the core research problem. This Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) led to better pedagogical effects on learning and teaching by (1) employing a vivid. enjoyable teaching approach, (2) adopting practical. interesting learning materials, and (3) creating a natural. enjoyable learning context. Both quantitative and qualitative findings of this study indicate that the students' English learning experiences were enhanced. as were their motivation and learning outcomes as a result of this HRI. This paper. instead of merely suggesting design criteria for robots. provides a set of instructional design guidelines that other researchers can follow to create an innovative and enjoyable English classroom that employs an interactive robot as an assistant for enhancing English acquisition while simultaneously reducing the pressure and teaching load of the English instructors.

175,Background: In medical education. a learner-centred approach is recommended. There is also a trend towards workplace-based learning outside of the hospital setting. In Australia. this has resulted in an increased need for General Practitioner (GP) supervisors who are receptive to using adult learning principles in their teaching. Little is known about what motivates Australian GP supervisors and how they currently teach.Methods: A qualitative study involving semi-structured interviews with 20 rural GP supervisors who work within one Regional Training Provider region in Australia explored their reasons for being a supervisor and how they performed their role. Data was analysed using a thematic analysis approach.Results: GP supervisors identified both personal and professional benefits in being a supervisor. as well as some benefits for their practice. Supervision fulfilled a perceived broader responsibility to the profession and community. though they felt it had little impact on rural retention of doctors. While financial issues did not provide significant motivation to teach. the increasing financial inequity compared with providing direct patient care might impact negatively on the decision to be or to remain a supervisor in the future.The principal challenge for supervisors was finding time for teaching. Despite this. there was little evidence of supervisors adopting strategies to reduce teaching load. Teaching methods were reported in the majority to be case-based with styles extending from didactic to coach/facilitator. The two-way collegiate relationship with a registrar was valued. with supervisors taking an interest in the registrars beyond their development as a clinician.Conclusion: Supervisors report positively on their teaching and mentoring roles. Recruitment strategies that highlight the personal and professional benefits that supervision offers are needed. Practices need assistance to adopt models of supervision and teaching that will help supervisors productively manage the increasing number of learners in their practices.

176,Purpose - This paper seeks to determine attitudes that impact on knowledge transfer between academics (university teaching and research staff) employed in today's competitive. technology-based university setting.Design/methodology/approach - The study generated a rich set of data by conducting. first. an exploratory. qualitative study followed by a confirmatory. quantitative study Through this process. an initial list of 402 attitudes to knowledge transfer was derived which was narrowed to 75 for the quantitative survey which. through factor analysis. was further reduced to 24 variables. The 24 variables were grouped into four factors for which trust and motivation are more relevant to the knowledge provider and absorptive capacity and knowledge regeneration for the receiverFindings - High levels of agreement were found for the propositions that senior academics lacked compensation for mentoring activities. and hence. the motivation to transfer knowledge. and that a heavy teaching load prevented the absorption of transferred knowledge. By contrast. disagreement was found with the propositions that an elderly age impeded the transfer of knowledge or adapting to new ways of transferring knowledge.Practical implications - From the responses obtained it was possible to identify those rated highly and from which conclusions could be drawn that may assist the university concerned to improve knowledge transfer among its academic staff. Compensation to senior academics for their time and effort was seen as the most important pre-requisite for knowledge transfer A reduction in teaching loads and the range of expectations to which academics are subjected would also facilitate knowledge transfer as would increasing academics' use of ICT and ability to assess its effectiveness. as well as recognising that knowledge transfer during social interactions may ameliorate the lack of knowledge transfer in the more formal. technology-based environment.Originality/value - The paper identifies key attitudes of academics to transferring knowledge to colleagues in the changing work place at universities in which academics are expected to perform at a high level in diverse activities and use technology to maximise their efficiency and effectiveness.

177,Integrated Design for Marketability and Manufacturing (IDMM at Stanford) is an Integrated Product Development course (IPD at Michigan) that is distinguished by hands-on manufacture of customer-ready prototypes executed by cross-disciplinary teams of students (MBAs and graduate Engineering and Design students) in a simulated economic competition against benchmark products and against each other. The course design is such that teams can succeed only by performing well in each of the marketing. manufacturing. engineering. and design dimensions. Student failure modes include adopting the wrong product strategy. failure to execute a sound strategy of producing a product that meets market needs. failure to drive costs down. poor product positioning and/or communication. poor forecasting and inventory management. and poor team dynamics. Instructors adopting this course model will face challenges that derive from its definitively cross-functional nature. The course involves faculty from Business. Engineering. and Design in a world where teaching load. compensation and infrastructural support is most often tallied on a unit-specific basis. The course requires faculty with broad interests in a world in which narrow academic depth is often more highly valued. Other challenges the course presents include maintaining a sense of fairness in the final product competition. so that students can move beyond the anger of a potential failure to learn from their experience. Also. in its current manifestations on the Stanford and Michigan campuses the course requires expensive general-purpose machine tools and instruction for students to build fully functional (customer-ready) product prototypes. We provide our current resolutions to these challenges. and the rewards for making the effort. In the end. the course's survivability can be traced to the benefits it provides to all stakeholders: students. faculty. and administrators. These benefits include a course that integrates disciplines in a way that students believe will increase their integrative skills and marketability. a course that faculty can embrace as a vehicle for their own development in teaching and research. and that administrators find sufficiently novel and engaging to attract the attention of outside constituencies and the press.

178,Purpose - This paper aims to explore the challenges faced by accounting educators in their attempts to incorporate IFRS materials in their teaching and explores the impact of various factors (instructor's attitude. size of accounting department. teaching load. type of institution. teaching experience and teaching materials) on the time spent on teaching IFRS materials in undergraduate accounting programmes.Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire survey was administered to faculty members working in Saudi Arabian universities. and interviews were held with a small number of such individuals in different universities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.Findings - The results indicate that the instructor's attitude and availability of IFRS materials exert the most influence upon the time spent by teachers on the IFRS. They further find that departmental support. familiarity with IFRS. training and teaching experience in IFRS are positively associated with the time spent on teaching the IFRS.Originality/value - The important implication is that accounting educators must adapt their teaching practice in light of the increasing adoption of the global financial reporting standards.

180,The authors model the class size and teaching load decisions of academic departments in terms of a departmental utility function. Utility is postulated to be asymmetric around class size and teaching load norms. and variables for curricular structure. disciplinary domain. and institutional type are taken into account. Maximization of the utility function produces decision rules for the number of sections to be offered for each course. and hence the faculty's overall teaching load. A nonlinear estimator is developed for the decision rules' parameters and applied to data from four liberal arts colleges and two research universities. Results are consistent with theories about faculty discretionary time and with expectations about the effects of curricular structure on class size. The paper concludes with a discussion about the effects of enrollment uncertainty on faculty load decisions. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

182,"Introduction: Although students often partake in peer-teaching activities during medical school. they are rarely provided with formal training in teaching. We have previously described our teacher training (TT) program for medical students. The TT program is delivered face-to-face across two sessions. In order to alleviate academic teaching load required to run the course. and at the same time provide our final-year students with practical opportunities to develop their leadership skills. we engaged five senior students as co-facilitators alongside academic staff. By developing an understanding of our students' motivation to participate as facilitators. we may be able to promote an interest within leadership in teaching among other students. Our study sought to examine students' motivation to take part as facilitators in the TT program.Methods: Data were collected through a focus group session with the five student facilitators. Self-determination theory. which poses that there are three elements key to intrinsic motivation. including autonomy. competence. and relatedness. was used as a conceptual lens to identify and code recurrent themes in the data.Results: Elements that motivated students to assist in facilitation included an opportunity to review and build on their knowledge and skills in teaching practices, the recognition and acknowledgement received from school staff and fellow students, the opportunity to develop these relationships, and a desire to increase their peer-teaching responsibilities.Conclusion: By actively involving our students in leadership practices. we were able to not only engage the students. but also develop our student community and contribute to the promotion of a culture of excellence in teaching within the hospital.

With the vision of becoming a metropolitan research university of distinction. BSU is transforming from a teaching-based to a research-based university. Embracing this transformation. BSU. s College of Engineering seeks to establish balanced workloads between teaching and scholarly activities among its faculty by providing appropriate evaluation. rewards. and support. During the 2009-2010 academic year. the college. s Teaching and Learning Committee conducted a survey with the full-time faculty members to better understand their perceptions about the current workload ratio between teaching and scholarly activities. the current evaluation and reward systems. and institutional support. A total of 69 full-time faculty members were invited to participate in the survey. and 42 of them (61{\%}) completed the survey. The primary results were: (1) Assistant and associate professors think that their actual teaching load is heavier than their ideal teaching load. (2) Full professors feel that they maintain a good balance between their teaching and scholarly activities and incorporate their research into teaching. (3) The faculty perceive different levels of performance expectations from the university. college and departments. (4) The faculty perceive that the reward system for excellent teaching is vague and insufficient in contrast to the reward system for scholarly activities. These results can be used to develop appropriate guidelines to assist faculty members during the process of institutional transformation from a teaching-based to a research-based university.

186,The casualization of higher education teaching staff is characteristic of the staffing composition in many universities throughout the world. The Australian AUTC report (2003) [10] found that the higher education sector has been the most casualised of all sectors with casual - or. as termed in Australia. sessional staff. representing 40{\%} of the teaching load in Australian universities. Sessional staff are defined (Red Report 2008 p. 4) as 'including any higher education instructors not in tenured or permanent positions. and employed on an hourly or honorary basis'. Universities employ casual teaching staff as a result of financial considerations and to be able to bring in expertise. Sessional teachers undertake a significant portion of. a 'full range of teaching activities' (Red Report. 2008 p. 16). Yet casual teaching staff are often marginalised from engaging in professional development/learning opportunities.This paper will present some preliminary findings of a pilot study which focuses on identifying some key challenges around engaging at even the first professional learning experience. an induction to teaching program. It aims to provide a sense of how sessional staff come to academic work in the first place. It is part of a wider longitudinal initiative that is currently being rolled out across the university.

187,"With the advent of computerized data searches. the number of accounting programs that use citation analysis to measure faculty members' research productivity has increased-often believing that this methodology offers relevant or reliable data for tenure. promotion. teaching load. and merit pay decisions. But such ""objective"" bases often ignore such factors as which journals to count. the effect of co-authorships. and article quality. Reliance on such citations can also cause ""uneven playing fields"" within the accounting discipline as well as among accounting and other areas or departments within schools of business.After reviewing the relevant literature. we present the results of a survey asking accomplished authors about the factors that make them more or less likely to cite an article. Since the process of counting citations focuses on quantity issues (as all citations ""count"" equally regardless of the citation's importance to the research article and the reasons for making the citation). we examine some quality issues that lead to authors citing others' research findings. The survey results indicate that. while citations often are based on the quality of the cited work. other factors less indicative of quality. such as authorship by a friend or colleague and publication in a U. S. journal. help to determine which relevant works are cited or not cited. We also suggest other measures to assess research quality to supplement or replace citation counts.

191,Education of veterinary students in radiological interpretation in veterinary schools in Germany. Austria and SwitzerlandIntroduction The teaching of radiological interpretation skills in human medicine has been criticized as being inadequate in view of the enormous impact of diagnostic imaging in daily clinical work. There are no data on the situation in veterinary medicine. We thus aimed 1. to assess the level and degree of education in radiology in German-speaking. veterinary schools and 2. to search current literature for procedural checklists.Materials and methods Veterinarians employed at the diagnostic imaging sections of the eight German speaking veterinary schools were asked by telephone interview or questionnaire for the number of staff and the teaching load in radiology. It included questions on the number of staff and the teaching load in radiology. Textbooks and scientific articles about veterinary and human radiology were scanned for structured aids to interpretation. A systemic procedure for the evaluation of radiological images was prepared.Results On average. 9.9 +/- 2.9 full-time equivalent positions were filled by professionals (veterinarians 5.7 +/- 2.1 and technicians 4.2 +/- 1.9) at the eight departments of veterinary radiology. Teaching of general and diagnostic radiology was offered in 67 +/- 26.1 teaching units. The number of mandatory and optional courses varied widely. A systematic approach to image interpretation is discussed in 40 of 73 reference books (54.8{\%}) and in eleven publications. A systematic step-by-step approach is offered in 19 publications.Conclusions Veterinarians graduated from german-speaking veterinary schools start their clinical work with highly variable theoretical skills and often inadequate clinical skills in diagnostic imaging. The current literature offers limited teaching aids as there are only few articles and checklists on systematic image interpretation methods.

194,Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the degree of satisfaction and perceived relevance of the Graduate Business Education (GBE) programme at the University of Botswana.Design/methodology/approach - A self-administered questionnaire and face to face interviews were used to collect data from Master of Business Administration (MBA) participants on their reason for studying MBA. level of satisfaction. and the extent to which the skills and experiences obtained correlate with those required by the corporate world. The data were analyzed using simple descriptive statistics.Findings - The majority of the respondents are male adults attending part time MBA classes and working full time in administrative positions in the public and private sectors. The study found that improved managerial skills. career development and broader business insights are major reasons for joining the MBA programme. while employability and economic gains were ranked low as driving forces. Even though the overall satisfaction with the programme is mixed and inconclusive. the MBA programme has assisted participants to develop basic management and administration skills. However. the programme puts greater emphasis on conceptual. technical and analytical skills than on problem solving. innovation. communication and entrepreneurial skills which are perceived to be most needed by employers. implying a relevance gap. What the MBA participants learnt does not correlate with what they perceived to be most needed by employers.Research limitations/implications - Since the findings are based on perceptions of MBA participants. the conclusions drawn from these findings must be considered tentative and interpreted with care. Future research must include representative sample of all MBA stakeholders such as faculty. students. graduates. employers and administrators to get rich information about quality of inputs. processes and products of MBA programme.Practical implications - There is strong need for the MBA programme to integrate traditional management and administrative skills with experiences and skills relevant for today's world of work. Bridging the growing theory-practice gap requires attracting professors with practical business experience. revising staff recruitment policies and procedures. establishing formal partnership with external organization. and develop long-term strategies to reduce teaching load and staff turnover.Originality/value - Most of the studies on the relevance and quality of GBE programmes are conducted in western higher education institutions. very little has been done in African universities. This is the first of its kind in the context of Botswana. an important contribution to existing literature and foundation for further advanced studies in the area.

199,"The post-Soviet teacher salary system is referred to as a ""teaching load"" (stavka) system. because the number of teaching hours accounts for the wide range of teachers' income. This article discusses the challenges of the stavka system. presents a few changes and modifications over time. and provides examples of salary reforms of two countries: the 2007 teacher salary reform in Mongolia and the 2011 reform in Kyrgyzstan. The UNICEF Kyrgyzstan study identifies six negative consequences of the high correlation between the salary and the number of hours taught: vulnerability of teachers. micromanagement of teachers. overcrowding of schools. vacancies as placeholders or ""strategic vacancies"". excessive teaching loads. the redistribution of teaching hours to non-specialists. The Government of Mongolia successfully replaced the teaching load system with a workload system in 2007. In Kyrgyzstan. the re-stratification process led to a revolt of those who lost in the wake of the reform.

202,In recent years. developing useful learning assistance systems has become a hot research topic in the literature. The learner can be benefited by the useful guidance provided by the learning assistance tool. An effective learning assistance tool can reduce the teaching load of the teacher. However. it is rarely seen that a learning assistance tool employs machine learning techniques to provide appropriate diagnosis or feedback to learners or teachers in the literature. We thus propose a learning assistance tool that employs reinforcement learning technique to continuously interact with the environment in order to offer learners suitable and timely feedback. guide them through the difficulties. Our experimental results reveal that our learning assistance tool can effectively enhance the learners' ICT application ability and assist the learners in overcoming difficulties. The teaching load of the teacher is also significantly reduced. PU  - SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN PI  - BERLIN PA  - HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3. D-14197 BERLIN. GERMANY

The specific contents and skills related to dance are included in 73{\%} of analyzed subjects. The 68{\%} of the SSBD locate this subject in 1st or 2nd year. From the study of the evaluation systems and their weighting on the final calcification. it follows that the vast majority of Spanish SSBC are committed to continuous and formative assessment in this subject through a combination of practical and written tests. as well as the written reports and projects. There were no significant differences in any of the structural and evaluation variables studied between the Spanish Public and Private Universities.

204,"This study investigated public school music curricula in general music. choral. band. and string programs within Indiana. Program characteristics were examined in relation to the school demographic characteristics of enrollment. percentage of minority students. and percentage of students receiving free lunch. Indiana public school districts (N=98) were randomly selected (sampling rate=33{\%}). Response rate by school corporation was 100{\%} and final response rate for the total sample of music teachers was 63.1 {\%} (N=391). Data were gathered by means of a survey. Teachers provided information concerning (a) music curricular offerings by area and grade level, (b) teaching load and instructional contact time, and. (c) class enrollments and performance activities. For each school district sampled. archival data were obtained from the State Department of Education and the Indiana State School Music Association. Among the results. wide variability was found in program characteristics. enrollment. participation rate. and performance activity. Approximately 64{\%} of the sample indicated general music as at least part of their teaching load. Teaching load was significantly correlated with time allocations for five of seven instructional activities in general music. Median student participation rates in music at the secondary level varied from 6 {\%} (strings) to 17{\%} (band) to 24{\%} (choral). Percentages for students on free lunch and minority students were generally not correlated with other variables. including participation rates. School and ensemble enrollments and amount of instructional time were generally not correlated with numbers of performances. String programs were reported for approximately 16{\%} of the sample school corporations and those that offered strings had larger school enrollments than those not offering strings.

205,"The search for correlates of scientific production is an important step toward the formulation of decision-making guidelines on academic and funding policy under a competitive system with continuously reduced budgets. Our goal here is to identify drivers of the scientific production of researchers working at the ""Universidade Federal de Goias"" (UFG). a medium-to-large public Brazilian University. focusing on the effects of teaching load and supervision of graduate and undergraduate students on scientific production of faculty members. We analyzed data for 1487 faculty members of UFG. including the total number of papers published between 2011-2013. a weighted-index of scientific production and the number of publications in high-ranked journals (according to a Brazilian system of journal ranking in different areas). These variables were regressed on gender. teaching load at undergraduate and graduate levels. number of supervised undergraduate. Master and Doctoral students. self-declared amount of time dedicated to research and outreach. year of doctoral graduation. year of hiring and the scientific production before doctoral graduation. Several regression models were used to model scientific production. including ordinary least-square regression and Hurdle negative binomial models. Although there are some differences among research areas. the most important explanatory variable was the publication record of the researcher before doctoral graduation. reinforcing the role of a solid academic formation in terms of research experience. Undergraduate and graduate teaching loads were negatively and positively correlated with scientific production. respectively. However. the strength of the relationship was much higher for the second than for the first relationship. These correlates of scientific production provide guidelines for policy and management in universities. including criteria for balancing research and teaching loads. awarding fellowships and research grants. designing new policy for future hiring and creation of new graduate programs.

206,"With the advent of computerized data searches. the number of accounting programs that use citation analysis to measure faculty members' research productivity has increased-often believing that this methodology offers relevant or reliable data for tenure. promotion. teaching load. and merit pay decisions. But such ""objective"" bases often ignore such factors as which journals to count. the effect of co-authorships. and article quality. Reliance on such citations can also cause ""uneven playing fields"" within the accounting discipline as well as among accounting and other areas or departments within schools of business.After reviewing the relevant literature. we present the results of a survey asking accomplished authors about the factors that make them more or less likely to cite an article. Since the process of counting citations focuses on quantity issues (as all citations ""count"" equally regardless of the citation's importance to the research article and the reasons for making the citation). we examine some quality issues that lead to authors citing others' research findings. The survey results indicate that. while citations often are based on the quality of the cited work. other factors less indicative of quality. such as authorship by a friend or colleague and publication in a U. S. journal. help to determine which relevant works are cited or not cited. We also suggest other measures to assess research quality to supplement or replace citation counts.

Two proposed models were examined using path analysis-one that linked financial exigency to job satisfaction and a second model with four variables mediating financial exigency and job satisfaction. The results showed that tenured faculty satisfaction was significantly affected by financial exigency but that nontenured faculty satisfaction was not affected. Further. only compensation and teaching load were significant mediators between financial exigency and job satisfaction. Implications for hospitality faculty and administrators are discussed.

With the vision of becoming a metropolitan research university of distinction. BSU is transforming from a teaching-based to a research-based university. Embracing this transformation. BSU. s College of Engineering seeks to establish balanced workloads between teaching and scholarly activities among its faculty by providing appropriate evaluation. rewards. and support. During the 2009-2010 academic year. the college. s Teaching and Learning Committee conducted a survey with the full-time faculty members to better understand their perceptions about the current workload ratio between teaching and scholarly activities. the current evaluation and reward systems. and institutional support. A total of 69 full-time faculty members were invited to participate in the survey. and 42 of them (61{\%}) completed the survey. The primary results were: (1) Assistant and associate professors think that their actual teaching load is heavier than their ideal teaching load. (2) Full professors feel that they maintain a good balance between their teaching and scholarly activities and incorporate their research into teaching. (3) The faculty perceive different levels of performance expectations from the university. college and departments. (4) The faculty perceive that the reward system for excellent teaching is vague and insufficient in contrast to the reward system for scholarly activities. These results can be used to develop appropriate guidelines to assist faculty members during the process of institutional transformation from a teaching-based to a research-based university.

211,Using data from a 2010 survey of academic chairs. this study reports on academic department chairs' recommended time allocations to new assistant professors. I contend that personal values about research and teaching influence the department chair's recommendations along with organizational characteristics. Multi-level modeling indicates that department chairs' own academic time allocations. promotion history. and desire for quality teaching as well as organizational characteristics such as research facilities. average teaching load. and research ranking influence the department chairs' advice. These results suggest that organizational characteristics do not dominate official. individual actions within the university setting as bureaucratic and neo-institutional theories might predict.

216,Education of veterinary students in radiological interpretation in veterinary schools in Germany. Austria and SwitzerlandIntroduction The teaching of radiological interpretation skills in human medicine has been criticized as being inadequate in view of the enormous impact of diagnostic imaging in daily clinical work. There are no data on the situation in veterinary medicine. We thus aimed 1. to assess the level and degree of education in radiology in German-speaking. veterinary schools and 2. to search current literature for procedural checklists.Materials and methods Veterinarians employed at the diagnostic imaging sections of the eight German speaking veterinary schools were asked by telephone interview or questionnaire for the number of staff and the teaching load in radiology. It included questions on the number of staff and the teaching load in radiology. Textbooks and scientific articles about veterinary and human radiology were scanned for structured aids to interpretation. A systemic procedure for the evaluation of radiological images was prepared.Results On average. 9.9 +/- 2.9 full-time equivalent positions were filled by professionals (veterinarians 5.7 +/- 2.1 and technicians 4.2 +/- 1.9) at the eight departments of veterinary radiology. Teaching of general and diagnostic radiology was offered in 67 +/- 26.1 teaching units. The number of mandatory and optional courses varied widely. A systematic approach to image interpretation is discussed in 40 of 73 reference books (54.8{\%}) and in eleven publications. A systematic step-by-step approach is offered in 19 publications.Conclusions Veterinarians graduated from german-speaking veterinary schools start their clinical work with highly variable theoretical skills and often inadequate clinical skills in diagnostic imaging. The current literature offers limited teaching aids as there are only few articles and checklists on systematic image interpretation methods.

This article describes a unique Canadian programme which has evolved in response to demand from an increasingly older and well-qualified applicant pool for recognition of their relevant previous educational experience. In an 8-week period in the summer of 1993. 18 students completed the requirements for Year I of the 4-year baccalaureate nursing programme. When compared to their generic counterparts. these 'fast-trackers' were found to be older. more likely to be part-time and. at the end of Year 2 were academically equivalent. Students in the programme were highly enthusiastic. citing the benefits of saving a year of student costs and of entering the profession a year earlier. Faculty involved with the programme were positive about the benefits for students. although a drawback for full-time faculty was the impact of a heavy summer teaching load on other scholarly activities. Because of the programme's success. consideration now being given to extending the fast-track option beyond Year I. PU  - CHURCHILL LIVINGSTONE PI  - EDINBURGH PA  - JOURNAL PRODUCTION DEPT.

This paper sets out the various positions in the national debate in Denmark. and then examines the attitudes towards these positions among the teaching staff at the country's largest university. Four topics are extracted from the debate - one which expresses a positive attitude towards English and three independent but interrelated topics which express more negative attitudes. The responses from the university lecturers show that a majority agree with all positions. negative as well as positive. This finding indicates that the attitude may not form a simple one-dimensional dichotomy. The responses are broken down according to lecturer age and the proportion of teaching the lecturer conducts in English. The results show that younger lecturers and lecturers with a higher teaching load in English are more positive towards the increase in English medium instruction.

224,Since 1997. the Korean Ministry of Education (MOE) has been implementing a primary school English program for the 3rd to the 6th grader as part of its globalization effort. After ten years of implementation. this program has been criticized for a lack of continuity between the primary and secondary school English curriculum. This problem is largely ascribed to the insufficient instructional hours for English classes offered in primary schools. Under the current system. 3rd and 4th graders take English classes once a week while 5th and 6th graders receive two classes per week. Accordingly. the MOE has piloted a new program to increase the number of instructional hours of primary school English classes. The present study surveyed 306 classroom teachers and 685 students who have participated in this pilot program to examine the positive and negative aspects of the new initiative. The findings show that while the participants felt that there was a clear need for increased instructional hours. they pointed out several barriers to quickly adopting the program. The main barriers to implementing the program were increased teaching load and a lack of highly qualified teachers. PU  - Korea Association Of Teachers Of English

226,This research examines accounting faculty job search and selection in the tightening academic job market. Surveys were sent to all new accounting Ph.D.s and to faculty who relocated from 2002 to 2004. The survey included 37 factors of importance (e.g.. salary. geographical location) to new Ph.D.s in selecting their initial faculty position and to relocating faculty. Overall. faculty appear to be very concerned with their teaching load. criteria used for promotion and tenure decisions. and compatibility with other faculty. Most faculty viewed likelihood of getting tenure as very important. We note that new faculty going to doctoral schools view this item as much less important than others. The opportunity to teach desired courses was much more important for those going to non-Ph.D.-granting schools. Most faculty viewed salary as being relatively important. but those going to nondoctoral institutions viewed salary as somewhat less important than geographic location. Examination of other factors suggested significant differences between different faculty groups.

Interviews with administration of higher education institutions prove that the orientation towards productivity indicators formulated in ranking systems is the case. Interviews (over 50) with heads of departments of these higher education institutions were carried out showing that the ""new managerialist"" policy does not comply to the existing practices of regulating academic work based on collegiality and informal redistribution of work. The main reason for this is the jobs which are not covered by contracts and therefore not paid. As a result. the amount of such jobs is only increasing administrative work. bureaucratic load (""paper work""). methodical support of teaching. In particular. heads of departments are regulating reproduction of the status systems of the departments they head. These informal mechanisms help to adapt to the increasing workload in supportive functions: the heads of departments regulate distribution of extra work informally. The understanding of quality in work is adapted to the demands of the departments promoting collegiality. reciprocity. rather than competition. The role of heads of departments in such circumstances becomes peculiar. On the one hand. administrative. bureaucratic and teaching load of heads of departments is growing.

Almost every university will be creating its own network and will be under a single net in the coming future. Certainly. these efforts will make the education in a cost-effective manner. Further. creation of the collaborative teaching and learning environment is essential so that the dropout rate remains low and the requirement of increasing number of learners and teaching load can reach a resolution by ICT means. The present paper discusses the education scenario. the upcoming efforts in the ICT developments and need of the collaborative environment for success of education in India.

234,The casualization of higher education teaching staff is characteristic of the staffing composition in many universities throughout the world. The Australian AUTC report (2003) [10] found that the higher education sector has been the most casualised of all sectors with casual - or. as termed in Australia. sessional staff. representing 40{\%} of the teaching load in Australian universities. Sessional staff are defined (Red Report 2008 p. 4) as 'including any higher education instructors not in tenured or permanent positions. and employed on an hourly or honorary basis'. Universities employ casual teaching staff as a result of financial considerations and to be able to bring in expertise. Sessional teachers undertake a significant portion of. a 'full range of teaching activities' (Red Report. 2008 p. 16). Yet casual teaching staff are often marginalised from engaging in professional development/learning opportunities.This paper will present some preliminary findings of a pilot study which focuses on identifying some key challenges around engaging at even the first professional learning experience. an induction to teaching program. It aims to provide a sense of how sessional staff come to academic work in the first place. It is part of a wider longitudinal initiative that is currently being rolled out across the university.

235,For students in Years 1-10 in Queensland. Australia. The Arts (hereafter referred to as 'arts') is one of eight Key Learning Areas in the core curriculum. Yet. while arts-comprising five strands including music is a mandatory component of the curriculum. implementation varies widely. This occurs for a range of reasons. one of which is the common practice that generalist teachers are allocated delivery of the arts programme in their teaching load. Furthermore. research reveals that music and the arts are frequently considered to be the 'frills subject' in a school's timetable. often the first to be removed from the timetable when time is short and the first to feel the impact of budget cuts. including the engagement of specialist arts educators (Russell-Bowie. 2004). This study highlights the gap between policy rhetoric for music and the arts and the pedagogical reality in generalist classrooms. Using a narrative informed case study methodology. a story constellation derived from a beginning generalist teacher and a school principal is revealed. The discussion which follows provides a focus. through the generation of key values statements derived from the data. on the tensions this beginning teacher has experienced in his practice as a teacher responsible for teaching music and the arts. juxtaposed with a similar narrative of the school principal.

236,The entrance of Spanish University System in the European Higher Education Area (EHEA) has brought with it a number of changes and challenges for teachers. These include the establishment of a common credit system that allows comparison between qualifications and promote student mobility. Adapting Spanish credits systems to the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS) has revolutionized both teachers and students as the system passes to count every credit hours taught by the teacher in hours of student work. The change in the definition in the workload has been significant. It has gone from a measure on the teaching load of a teacher evaluation unit volume of student work. This change also results in a change in the angle of vision of our education system going from teaching focus to student-learning focus. Also. among its EHEA objectives arises the challenge of ensuring quality in higher education with comparable criteria and methodologies. Given these challenges. we believe collaboration among different disciplines is necessary when defining and implementing new teaching methods or approaches. and their subsequent evaluation and verification of students' results. Hence the idea of designing a study. starting from the Faculty of Education. in order to discuss these requirements in relation to assessment and methodological aspects in different degrees. This paper presents the initial stages of planning and design of the study developed in several degrees from the University of Cantabria.

237,"The purpose of this study is to investigate high school English teachers' perceptions about their teaching job. The study focused on four areas, instruction. relationship with students and parents. working environment. and teaching profession. For this study. 126 English teachers from 15 different middle schools in Kyungnam province participated. and a questionnaire was used for the investigation. The findings revealed that the teachers perceived positively the effect of English class on students' English learning. and their dedication and confidence to English teaching was high. However. the teachers responded that they mainly used grammar translation method in class and viewed the lack of time for preparing their class and various limitations using learner-centered activities as the most significant problem. Also. the teachers responded that they had hard time in class because of students' demotivation and students' different English proficiency. Teachers in this study felt stressed due to the teaching load and excessive nonessential workload. It should be noted that among 126 English teachers. only 26 English teachers answered that they would be a high school English teacher if they could choose a teaching job again. In order to adequately support hight school English teachers. the factors influencing teachers' perceptions should be explored in relation to the teaching career and the size of the school.

238,The purpose of this study was to analyze the structure and system of clinical practice in an early childhood teacher education program in one of the universities located in the eastern part of the US. Findings were. first. the clinical practice  was implemented for 16 weeks. placing teacher candidates in the public school classrooms of PreK through 3rd grade. and providing opportunities to fulfill gradually increased teaching load. Second. teacher candidates were required meeting several conditions to start the clinical practice. and there were several regulations for them to follow during their clinical practice. Third. teacher candidates practiced and learned not only instructional skills but also most roles of early childhood teachers in public school settings. Fourth. teacher candidates were required completing various assignments. and presenting them in a Student Teaching Notebook. Fifth. teacher candidates' performances were evaluated at least 7 times. 6 formative evaluations and the final summative evaluation. by both university supervisor and cooperating teacher using assessment tools developed by the university. A special program was also provided to the candidates facing difficulties and problems in their performances. Finally. the final grade of clinical practice was assigned by the university supervisor on the basis of the evaluation results of teaching performances and quality of their assignments. Based on these findings. suggestions were derived for further studies to improve educational practicum in early childhood teacher education in Korea.

239,Purpose. To describe the utility of school-wide use of mission-based reporting (MBR) for medical school deans and department chairs.Method. All faculty members in the University of California. Davis. School of Medicine reported their clinical. creative. teaching. and service activities for 2000-2001 to the MBR system. The authors report on school-wide and department MBR profiles. and profiles by rank and academic series. They validate MBR by comparing individual results with actual merit actions reviewed independently by the school's academic personnel 0 committee.Results. A total of 419 faculty members (85{\%}) completed their MBR reports. The average faculty member spent considerably more than 50 hours per week fulfilling the missions of the school. and full professors and faculty members in academic series supported by state funds were the most productive in investigative and creative work. The teaching load was shared equally by all the academic ranks. although the clinician-scholars taught more than did faculty members in the other series. There was an inverse relationship between clinical load and academic rank. with the majority of the clinical work performed by junior faculty members. MBR results compared favorably with the merit review process. although MBR is not expected to replace the traditional peer review system.Conclusion. The creation of these graphic profiles and summaries is a valuable feature of MBR that would not have been possible without such quantitative data. The profiles allow monitoring to ensure that workload conforms to established objectives for individuals. departments. academic ranks and series. Finally. the authors discuss future directions for their MBR system. PU  - LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS {\&} WILKINS PI  - PHILADELPHIA PA  - TWO COMMERCE SQ. 2001 MARKET ST. PHILADELPHIA. PA 19103 USA
240,Background: Nursing and midwifery education have comparatively recently moved into academia in Ireland. In 2002. nurse tutors who were qualified to Master's degree level assimilated into the third-level sector. Only 11 of the 35 staff (31{\%}) in one university School held. or were undertaking. a PhD. In 2006. children's nursing and midwifery tutors also moved into third-level institutions. The culture of all assimilating tutors was focussed on teaching. rather than research.Objectives: The School set ambitious plans to develop the research abilities of all academics. setting the goal that 75{\%} of academic staff would either hold. or be undertaking. a PhD by 2010. Objectives were also set to increase external research funding. peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations.Methods: A combination of sabbatical leaves. student stipends and periods of reduced teaching load was introduced to provide staff with protected time for doctoral studies. Funding for conference and research expenses was provided. based on the previous year's research output of publications. conference presentations and external funding submissions.Results: By October 2010. 79{\%} of the 66 School staff either had (n = 23). or were conducting (n = 29). PhDs. surpassing goals set. Peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations had increased by {\textgreater}20{\%} per year and external research funding totalled (sic)6.351.101 for the previous 5 years.Conclusions: Strong research leadership. generous support and liberal encouragement can change a predominantly teaching-focussed culture to one of academic research excellence. This increase in research expertise will lead to better patient/client care and improved education of nursing and midwifery students. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

241,"Introduction: Although students often partake in peer-teaching activities during medical school. they are rarely provided with formal training in teaching. We have previously described our teacher training (TT) program for medical students. The TT program is delivered face-to-face across two sessions. In order to alleviate academic teaching load required to run the course. and at the same time provide our final-year students with practical opportunities to develop their leadership skills. we engaged five senior students as co-facilitators alongside academic staff. By developing an understanding of our students' motivation to participate as facilitators. we may be able to promote an interest within leadership in teaching among other students. Our study sought to examine students' motivation to take part as facilitators in the TT program.Methods: Data were collected through a focus group session with the five student facilitators. Self-determination theory. which poses that there are three elements key to intrinsic motivation. including autonomy. competence. and relatedness. was used as a conceptual lens to identify and code recurrent themes in the data.Results: Elements that motivated students to assist in facilitation included an opportunity to review and build on their knowledge and skills in teaching practices, the recognition and acknowledgement received from school staff and fellow students, the opportunity to develop these relationships, and a desire to increase their peer-teaching responsibilities.Conclusion: By actively involving our students in leadership practices. we were able to not only engage the students. but also develop our student community and contribute to the promotion of a culture of excellence in teaching within the hospital.

242,Relative value units exist for measuring clinical productivity. Limited objective measures exist. however. for nonclinical activities. specifically teaching. Objective: To develop an objective measure of teaching productivity linked to a performance-based incentive plan. Methods: Teaching goals and objectives were identified before the 1998-1999 academic year. Teaching value units (TVUs). objective measures for quantifying teaching activities. were developed and assigned based on an estimation of time needed to complete each activity and weighted for importance to the teaching mission. Each physician was allocated teaching time based on past performance and future goals. Targeted TVUs necessary to meet expectations were proportionate to allocated teaching time. Teaching productivity was defined as a percentage of targeted TVUs achieved. Incentive dollars for teaching were distributed based on percentage of targeted TVUs achieved. weighted individually for teaching load. Results: Teaching productivity was evaluated over a three-year period. In year 1. mean TVUs allocated/physician were 181 units (range 25 to 449). Four of 18 physicians (22{\%}) met expectations. The mean individual TV-Us achieved were 54{\%} of expected (range 0{\%} to 114{\%}). By year 3. mean TVUs allocated/physician were 179 (range 45 to 629). Twelve of 22 physicians (55{\%}) met expectations. The mean individual TVUs achieved were 82{\%} of expected (range 11{\%} to 146{\%}). Between year 1 and year 3. group productivity increased from 73{\%} to 88{\%}. and mean individual productivity increased from 54{\%} to 82{\%} (p=0.01). Conclusions: The development of a TVU-based system enabled objective quantification and monitoring of a broad range of teaching activities. The TVU-based system linked to an incentive plan helped to increase individual and group teaching productivity. PU  - WILEY PI  - HOBOKEN PA  - 111 RIVER ST. HOBOKEN 07030-5774. NJ USA
243,Framed in the European Higher Education Area (EHEA from now on). new degree courses generally assume a greater daily monitoring of individual work of each student: more classroom exercises and academically guided activities are proposed. presence is controlled.. Although a small number of students per group would be desirable. in many cases we dealt with classes of a hundred or more students. Particularly in Spain. this new work culture has little support by society and it is difficult to propose exercises individually worked by students because the plagiarism between them (only the supervision of a teacher in classroom assure the control of learning and skills acquired for each student). Generally. the responses received from universities to these changes have been poor and low: the number of students per classroom or group remains the same as before the introduction of the European Credit. teachers usually not afford additional help in this task or even. for reasons that are irrelevant to argue. they are mostly overloaded with more teaching load. In addition. this style of work is often very different between different areas of knowledge. Therefore. the monitoring of students by the teacher becomes very difficult or even impossible and. finally. these circumstances force to adopt a style similar to the previous work. giving up this new philosophy. The new titles are merely a redistribution of credits. far from the purpose initially conceived and intended. In this paper. we present some ideas experienced in the classroom that mitigate the constraints outlined above by using new technologies.

244,James Dwight Dana (1813-1895) was one of the most prolific and influential American geologists of the nineteenth century. He also established patterns and set precedents that contributed to the establishment of the American geological and scientific communities and the possibility of pursuing geology as a career. At the same time. Dana's career was unique in several ways.The son of a New York merchant family. Dana struggled to prove that science could be a career for a man required to earn his own way in the world. In a time when federal funding for science was both controversial and relatively rare. Dana obtained a paid position with the United States South Pacific (Wilkes's) Exploring Expedition. This provided him with income. unparalleled experience literally around the globe. and. in the expedition reports. a publisher for the works that would make him a scientist of international repute.Dana moved from working on the Expedition reports to a specially created professorship at Yale. where he spent the rest of-his career. His position at Yale provided an income and a teaching load light enough for him to carry on myriad other tasks. Among these were the editorship of the American Journal of Science. authorship of numerous professional papers and teaching texts. and the maintenance of a large network of correspondence. These activities ensured his continued influence and importance in the American scientific community and allowed him to elucidate a uniquely American geology and defend it as the proper model for geologists around the world.

245,The floor of the NY Stock Exchange. with its noise and chaos. is an apt depiction of the typical course selection meeting that many universities experience. Professors attempt to shout over their colleagues or broker deals with one another in small cabals in an attempt to garner the sections they hope to teach. When first choices fall by the wayside. quick recalculations of schedules are necessary in order to determine the next best scenario and sections to request.As inexperienced junior faculty members. the authors found this experience daunting. In response. they wrote a simple web application that allowed faculty to make their selections. and broker deals. in a calm manner over an extended time period. The application was originally written for one sub-group of about 20 faculty within the department. but its popularity quickly spread to the rest of the department and then on to other departments within the college.The Course Assignment and Reservation System (CARS) has grown steadily over the past several years in number of users. functionality. and scope. Today. faculty can plan their teaching load. work with colleagues to find mutually beneficial schedules. and easily retrieve historical information in preparation for annual reviews. promotion. or tenure appointments. Department administrators can manage course information. prepare information for certification agencies. assign faculty to courses. and monitor faculty loads. Staff and students also benefit from interfaces permitting access to appropriate information to assist them in their planning activities. Utilizing Web 2.0 technologies. the application is enjoyable to use and gives all of the disparate users a satisfying experience PU  - IEEE PI  - NEW YORK PA  - 345 E 47TH ST. NEW YORK. NY 10017 USA
246,"Background: Productive faculty are key to generating new knowledge and advancing pharmacy practice. The work environments of academic pharmacists are critical to their vitality. commitment. and longevity. Objectives: To (1) identify correlates of faculty scholarly productivity and teaching effectiveness. considering personal and environmental characteristics, (2) determine the relationship between a faculty's perception of organizational citizenship behaviors they witness with the organizational culture of their employing college/school of pharmacy, and (3) describe the relationship between organizational climate. job satisfaction. and commitment of academic pharmacists.Methods: A self-administered survey was disseminated to a random sample of U.S. academic pharmacists acquired from AACP list-servs. The survey measured perceptions of their organization's culture. the organizational citizenship behaviors they witness at their institution. their job satisfaction. teaching load and productivity. and scholarly productivity based upon peer-reviewed scholarly papers accepted. Both bivariate and multivariate (regression) procedures were employed to identify factors most responsible for explaining academic pharmacist's work environment.Results: Responses were received from 177 of 600 survey recipients. Faculty reported having had accepted 10.9 +/- 13.6 papers in peer-reviewed journals during the previous 5 years. with most of those in journals with relatively low Impact Factor scores. Faculty productivity was related to type of academic institution employed. teaching effectiveness. job satisfaction. and other factors. Organizational citizenship behaviors and organizational culture was seen similarly by faculty of varied ranks and experience levels. Commitment to remain at the current college/school of pharmacy was highly associated with culture. climate. and job satisfaction conditions.Conclusions: The results provided evidence for a strong connection or nexus between teaching and research effectiveness. Organizational culture of academic pharmacy programs is highly important for faculty vitality and commitment. The findings should be helpful for academic leaders in devising programs for mentoring. development. and retention of faculty. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

247,Possible differences in teaching approaches to university teaching at the disciplines address that faculty members' conceptions of teaching should be explored within specific disciplines in order to develop institutional opportunities for improving teaching and learning [1]. Young faculty members' conceptions are important in order to understand how these conceptions are formed and how they could be targeted in faculty training programs for improving university teaching. Therefore. this study explored the young engineering faculty members' conceptions of teaching. Six young engineering faculty members (three female and three male) were interviewed about their views regarding teaching in their fields. departments' trends about teaching. and university context in general. Specifically. the influence of the nature of the knowledge they taught. the institutional contexts. previous experiences and the other responsibilities they had for their jobs on their teaching conceptions were explored. Findings revealed that young engineering faculty had already established teaching conceptions based on their previous experiences and the difficulties they had during their undergraduate education. Faculty members whom they addressed as effective teachers had a considerable influence on their teaching conceptions. Their conceptions were influenced by the nature of the knowledge they taught as they focused on explaining the major concepts. clarifying the important points. and placing the concepts within an application context. They were not allowed to decide on the teaching content and assessment practices in crowded departments where courses were taught in teams. Yet. they struggled with preparing assessment tasks and were not sure in their effectiveness. Elements of effective classes included faculty member's and students' interest on the concepts. focus on fundamental issues and mistakes. applications. and student participation. Findings addressed that the pressure of research requirements for tenure and the teaching load might be limiting them in managing their efforts and resources in planning for teaching and developing new conceptions.

248,An original cross-sectional dataset referring to a medium-sized Italian university is implemented in order to analyze the determinants of scientific research production at individual level. The dataset includes 942 permanent researchers of various scientific sectors for a 3-year time-span (2008-2010). Three different indicators-based on the number of publications and/or citations-are considered as response variables. The corresponding distributions are highly skewed and display an excess of zero-valued observations. In this setting. the goodness-of-fit of several Poisson mixture regression models are explored by assuming an extensive set of explanatory variables. As to the personal observable characteristics of the researchers. the results emphasize the age effect and the gender productivity gap-as previously documented by existing studies. Analogously. the analysis confirms that productivity is strongly affected by the publication and citation practices adopted in different scientific disciplines. The empirical evidence on the connection between teaching and research activities suggests that no univocal substitution or complementarity thesis can be claimed: a major teaching load does not affect the odds to be a non-active researcher and does not significantly reduce the number of publications for active researchers. In addition. new evidence emerges on the effect of researchers administrative tasks-which seem to be negatively related with researcher's productivity-and on the composition of departments. Researchers' productivity is apparently enhanced by operating in department filled with more administrative and technical staff. and it is not significantly affected by the composition of the department in terms of senior/junior researchers.

249,Introduction/Background.The creation of the European Higher Education Area (EHEA) establishes a system of degrees whose top level includes Degree studies with syllabi that contain a high teaching load of a practical nature in Health Sciences studies.At our University. the compulsory Biochemisty subject is taught in the first year of Nursing Degree studies. This subject is considered an important subject in curricular terms. which allows future Nursing students to acquire knowledge about the composition and structure of the human body. and about the physico-chemical processes performed in its cell structures. and how the human organism works. Part of this learning is offered during laboratory practical session when students have the chance to analytically determine body fluids. among others. It is interesting for students as it goes beyond the theoretical concepts taught in master classes.Thus it is considered interesting to know the expectations that students have before their first practical laboratory class. their degree of satisfaction afterwards. and the improvement proposals that they consider interesting..ObjectiveTo know our Nursing Degree students' expectations before their first practical laboratory class. where technical nursing knowledge is offered. and their degree of satisfaction and a series of improvement proposals after this classMethodA quanti-qualitative study about 106 first-year Nursing Degree students faced with their first practical laboratory class as part of the Biochemistry subject. during which a series of usual nursing techniques were given (measuring parameters in blood and urine).With a questionnaire that we devised. and prior to giving the practical class. students' expectations of the practical class were evaluated. After this session. their degree of satisfaction and if their expectations were fulfilled were evaluated. Students also suggested a series of improvements. The questionnaire included closed and open (qualitative) questions. and socio-demographic data.ResultsThe mean score that students gave to the practical class before participating in it was 8.21 points (SD +/- 0.98). which rose to 9.18 points (SD +/- 0.88) after participating (p{\textless}0.001). The practical class not only equalled students' expectations. but surpassed them and their degree of satisfaction was high. One improvement proposal stood out. that of including more material resources and techniques to perform practical sessions. Students stated that the most interesting aspect for them was to undertake the techniques. whose application they considered useful for them when they are nurses in the future.ConclusionsStudents' expectations of their first practical laboratory session that centred on Nursing techniques were high. and their degree of satisfaction remained high after this session. The improvement proposals made by students were valuable and must be taken into account when planning syllabi and teaching practical classes PU  - IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION {\&} DEVELOPMENT PI  - VALENICA PA  - LAURI VOLPI 6.

250,Undergraduate research allows faculty mentors to collaborate with students in order to make an original or creative contribution to a particular discipline. Traditional undergraduate research is often driven by a research question related to the mentor's research program or developed by the student. Students perform a background search on the subject. develop a hypothesis. collect experimental data. and then submit a manuscript for publication or an abstract describing a completed project. Advancing cognitive and intellectual growth of the students and increasing job satisfaction and professional development of the faculty mentors are some of the benefits of undergraduate research.Implementation of traditional undergraduate research programs at primarily teaching colleges presents several challenges. These include the requirement to carry a full teaching load that limits the time devoted to research for students' mentors. the lack of funds allocated to research. the limited grant writing assistance. and the deficient laboratory technical assistance and facilities. In addition to these challenges. undergraduate research is difficult to assess or to integrate within an established curriculum.In this report we describe the development of a modular. learning objective-driven research course in biotechnology as part of an undergraduate biology minor. The research course described in this pilot study is currently being evaluated by the instructor using descriptive rubrics and take-home exams. Its assessment also takes into consideration the students' perspective using institutional course evaluations. on-going group discussions. and surveys of course learning gains. Based on our preliminary results. this type of undergraduate research experience has several advantages over traditional undergraduate research. One of these advantages is the higher emphasis on the learning and skill development involved in the research process. as opposed to traditionally emphasizing the success of the experiment. or its data collection and dissemination. Another advantage is the lower requirement of funds and time to implement as compared to a traditional undergraduate research experience.Based on students' feedback. this course allows students to appreciate all the different aspects of the biotechnology research process including troubleshooting when experiments do not work as expected. gaining practice in the use of lab instrumentation not used in regular courses. designing of experiments by using cheaper and faster methods. critically evaluating specialized scientific literature and obtaining and disseminating original results worth of publication. The students also learn how to communicate or summarize their own thought processes. procedures and results with clarity by breaking down the information and presenting it with a simpler language.The results of this pilot study suggest that the careful implementation of undergraduate research courses driven by the assessment of learning objectives and based on a faculty research program may be a good method to integrate biotechnology research into the curriculum of primarily teaching institutions.

251,Introduction/Background: The European Higher Education Area (EHEA) establishes a system of Degrees with Degree studies at its first level. whose syllabi consist of a high practical teaching load in studies of the Health Sciences branch.At our University. the Maternity Nursing subject is compulsory and is taught in year 2 of Nursing Degree studies. It aims to qualify students to pay comprehensive attention to women throughout their life cycle. and in the different stages and situations of their sexual and reproductive life (pregnancy. birth. puerperium. climaterium). to accomplish an optimum health status through prevention or recovering ill women's health. Part of this learning is given in practical seminars. Collaborative learning involves students during their own learning process. and improving their memory of the subject. their attitude towards learning. and their interpersonal relationships (intra- and intergroup). Students tend to find this interesting because it goes beyond the theoretical concepts taught in master classes. and encourages learning through peers.Thus. we consider interesting to approach and implement collaborative learning into practical seminars. and to know our students' degree of satisfaction with this practical learning and their possible improvement proposals after participating in it.Objective: To implement and bring closer collaborative learning to our Nursing Degree students for the practical seminars in the Maternity Nursing subject. and to know their degree of satisfaction and series of proposals to improve it.Method: A quanti-qualitative study about 108 year-2 Nursing Degree students registered for the Maternity Nursing subject. It included a practical seminar about the different existing family planning methods and techniques.Following the collaborative learning methodology. the students were divided into four practical groups. which were subdivided into subgroups to work on the different family planning methods and techniques. who shared their information with the other subgroups. The teacher acted as a guide for this activity and provided complementary material. After this practical seminar. students' degree of satisfaction was assessed and they indicated some improvement proposals.Results: In our study. 75.7{\%} of the students were female and 24.3{\%} were male. The mean score that the practical seminar participants gave was 8.3 points (SD +/- 0.8). Their degree of satisfaction after attending the seminar was high. One outstanding improvement proposal was to include more material resources to allow students to practice more family planning means/techniques. What the students found most interesting was the learning method employed which favoured their interaction. and the new knowledge they acquired as they can apply it as future nurses.Conclusions: Student satisfaction with the collaborative learning-based practical seminar was high. not only for the knowledge they acquired while they participated in it. but also for its dynamics and the method followed. The improvement proposals made by students allow curricular planning to improve and such activities to be performed PU  - IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION {\&} DEVELOPMENT PI  - VALENICA PA  - LAURI VOLPI 6.

252,"The changes made in university education. by the Bologna Process. have resulted that teachers get involved in assuring that students acquire a range of capacities. during their training. In particular. the transversal capacities will be very useful for their future professional life.This change is helped by introducing the model of ""tutorial action"". During these years. it can be analysed whether the teaching staff has been involved in this tutorial and students have responded too.Unfortunately. an excessive teaching load and not being appreciated any merit for this extra work. are possible causes for the teachers' declining interest in this tutorial. Furthermore. it must be taken into account that the students' lack of interest. whom do not respond when the teacher convene them. may negatively influence the teacher.From the performance of the Tutorial Action Plan of the University of Burgos the authors of this paper. who are part of GIDUT-Teaching Innovation Group. have been surveying different aspects related to academic tutorials and transversal skills. Some of their findings have been presented in previous ICERI congresses.The methodology used makes a selection of general capacities. in various degrees offered by the University of Burgos. and it drafts questionnaires with 22 items which students must answer. In the present article. the case study is students from various training courses and two different degrees: Sciences orientation (Chemistry) and Health Sciences orientation (Science and Food Technology. SFT).The results presented. present academic year (2014/2015). are: four items related to general capacities acquired by the student and two items related to students' satisfaction with the attended tutorials. The evaluation of these results allows us to detect: the students' interest for tutorials. their knowledge about transversal capacities. just as much how important these capacities are for the students and which one is considered by as essential for their degree.In relation to tutorials. many students do not attend them and that may cause the discouragement suffered by the professors of the Faculty of Sciences. But there are some students displease with their tutors, as it was reflected in the 27{\%} of students in 3rd level of SFT who said that they did not meet in person his tutor yet. This is particularly troubling and measures shall be considered to encourage teachers to get involved in the tutorial action. to help students during their university degree.In relation to transversal competences an eye-catching result. which reflects the current society. is the students' lack of interest for the ethical-social commitment capacity. For Health Sciences. among students form 3rd and 4th course of SFT. the 16.4{\%} and 16.7{\%} respectively show that this capacity deserves just a 1 or 2. Its rating goes from 1 to 5. being 1 the lowest score. For Chemistry. Sciences orientation. students form 1st course rate this competition even worse. as a result the 27{\%} of students rate it as 1 or 2. These results shall lead us to place resources to encourage students in their ethical and social responsibility.

253,"Introduction. In the context of fundamental changes which have occurred in the last decades in the world of professions and transition from mono-professionalism to poly-professionalism. a modern man needs to have an ability to freely navigate the modern labour market. to quickly diversify contents and quality of the professional activity. and. if thought appropriate. to change an occupation without difficulty. Nowadays. the requirements for the teachers of vocational training are designed in a completely different way to provide high-quality lifelong learning.The aim of the research is to reveal the psychological readiness of teachers of vocational school for the development of new types of learning activities in the conditions of a professional reorientation.Methodology and research methods. The methodological framework of the present research is based on conceptual provisions of the personal-focused. subject. competency-based and system approaches to vocational education. as well as theories of the psychology of abilities and organization of continuing the professional education of adults. General scientific methods such as analysis. synthesis. specification and generalization were applied. Techniques of psychological and pedagogical observation and questionnaire were used at the diagnostic phase of the study as the leading ones.Results and scientific novelty. The concepts of ""professionalization"". ""professional self-determination"". ""transprofessional competencies"" and ""psycho-pedagogical assistance"" are clarified. It is stated that under the increasingly complex socio-cultural and professional environment there is the need for pedagogical personnel capable to carry out continuing training and retraining of mid-level professionals for the real sector of the economy and the social sphere in compliance with the international standards and advanced technologies. Based on the content of scientific sources. a list of systematically important transprofessional competencies to provide psychological readiness of teachers of vocational school for new kinds of activities is drawn up. Results of a diagnostic questioning are described, the respondents were teachers and employees of methodical offices of vocational-oriented education of various colleges of Yekaterinburg and Novouralsk who do not have a basic pedagogical education. Using the processing of the obtained data. it is established that teachers. on the one hand. understand the essence and objectives of their work, on the other. they can not independently respond to their personal needs to reevaluate own professional position due to the use of outdated methods and stereotypic ways of training. Conclusions are drawn that most of the interviewed teachers have no ability to conduct overtime professional activity that enables to carry a standard teaching load, a considerable part of teachers need acquisition of additional pedagogical and transprofessional competencies.The authors outlined the proposal to develop a combinatory technology of psycho-pedagogical support for teachers of vocational schools to improve the current situation. The functionality of this technology. its tasks. structural components. possible methods and estimated effects of its implementation in practice of the SPE (Secondary Professional Education) system are noted.Practical significance. The materials of the present paper can be useful for managerial staff. psychologists and training specialists of the SPE system who are engaged in the issues of teacher professional development.

254,Literature indicates that the academic work role and. by implication. academics suffer tremendous pressure and that this role will probably be difficult to maintain and sustain in future. This is the result of numerous external and internal influences within and outside of higher education. The internal and external aspects impacting on higher education should. however not be regarded in isolation. since there is a systemic interdependence between these aspects which collectively form and dominate the current higher education environment.External aspects which currently influence the academic work role and will continue to do so in future. include globalisation and the increased application of advanced information technology and technology within all aspects of higher education. Literature also indicates a shift in higher education from institutions that were primarily the domain of the elite to institutions that strive to admit a greater variety and larger numbers of students who do not necessarily possess the required academic foundation. The increasing competition among institutions in order to ensure survival and financial sustainability contributes to the fact that - like all other organisations - higher education institutions (and by implication academics) continually have to pay attention to the changing needs and requirements of their primary clients. namely the labour sector students. and governments. Maintaining and ensuring ongoing quality are currently high on the agenda of higher education and most higher education institutions. Implementing and ensuring quality in higher education institutions relate to and address all aspects of higher education. including curriculum development. teaching and research - all of which must be managed by academics.The academic work role is. however not only influenced by external realities. but also by various internal realities. One of the primary aims of any higher education institution is making available and establishing high quality teaching and learning experiences for its students. Academic staff members are primarily responsible for establishing and managing these aspects and learning environments. However the way in which teaching and learning takes place is influenced by numerous aspects. including higher student numbers as a result of among other things. greater accessibility and the incorporation of technology (as previously mentioned). Literature indicates that research. which is one of the core tasks of any academic. may be under pressure as a result of among other things. the absence of resources and structures. In addition academics complain about a lack of time to do research because other tasks have to be undertaken concurrently. Yet research is regarded as the most important criterion whereby academics obtain stature and promotion. In addition to teaching and research responsibilities. the work pressure of academics is increased due to further responsibilities in the form of increased community service. and administration and entrepreneurial activities. Although administrative responsibilities form apart of the non-core activities of academics. they require additional time and inputs in an already complex work environment.In order to address the preceding dilemmas resulting from the internal and external realities. part-time teaching staff members are appointed to decrease the teaching load of full-time appointed academic personnel. Although temporary teaching staff members are utilised. full-time academics still bear the supervisory responsibilities and carry the administrative load associated with this type of appointment by higher education institutions.Higher education institutions - more so than any other organisation - depend on the intellectual abilities and the commitment of academic staff. The intellectual and creative abilities of this group largely determine the existence and sustainability of higher education institutions. The preceding changes and re
255,Purpose The implementation of a reformed curriculum for undergraduate medical education with a problem-oriented focus and more bedside teaching in small groups increases the academic teaching workload. The aim of this study was to investigate whether this increase in teaching duties is associated with an increase in report turnaround times of radiologists or increased unplanned absence during term times compared with term breaks (lecture-free periods) and over the whole period under investigation.Materials and Methods The database of all radiological examinations performed at a large German university hospital was retrospectively analyzed for a two-year period from the winter term 2011/12 to the summer term 2013. A total of 192 984 radiological examinations performed during this period were included in an analysis of reporting times (i.e.. time from end of examination to completion of report) during term times versus term breaks. Reporting times were analyzed for all radiological examinations and for intensive care unit (ICU) patients. In addition. radiologists' schedules were analyzed in terms of teaching duties. unplanned absence. vacation days. and days away from work for education and training.Results During the period under investigation. the teaching load increased from overall 1.75 hours/day in the winter term 2011/12 to 6.49 hours/day in the summer term 2013 and in the term break from overall 0.10 hours/day in the winter term 2011/12 to 0.71 hours/day in the summer term 2013. Reporting time increased during this period (p {\textless} 0.05) but remained shorter during term times than during term breaks. The difference between term and term break for ICU patients was not significant. There was no increase in unplanned absences during term times.Conclusion Overall. radiologists' reporting times increased during the period when the reformed curriculum for undergraduate medical education was implemented. As this was observed both during term and during term breaks. increased teaching duties alone cannot serve as a sole causal explanation.

257,"The problem under study is current and relevant due to the contradiction between the understanding of the need to digitalize the educational process. to overcome the ""digital gap"" in the student-teacher relationship. and the lack of an effective method for improving the skills of the teaching staff that allows them to organize their professional activities using digital technologies.The teaching load of the university teacher. the variety of digital technologies and methods of their use in the educational process do not allow to organize advanced training courses in a mode parallel to the main educational process of the university and in isolation from the electronic information and education environment of the institution.In this regard. this article is aimed at testing the hypothesis that the successful digitalization of the educational process in a separate educational institution is facilitated by mass training courses organized with direct immersion of participants in the digital environment.The leading method of studying this problem was a pedagogical experiment conducted among university teachers and students. which allowed us to identify a positive trend in the readiness of teachers to use the possibilities of the electronic information and education environment of the university based on the results of the proposed method.

259,"Background The unique feature of the Internet is that individual negative attitudes toward minoritized and racialized groups and more extreme. hateful ideologies can find their way onto specific platforms and instantly connect people sharing similar prejudices. The enormous frequency of hate speech/cyberhate within online environments creates a sense of normalcy about hatred and the potential for acts of intergroup violence or political radicalization. While there is some evidence of effective interventions to counter hate speech through television. radio. youth conferences. and text messaging campaigns. interventions for online hate speech have only recently emerged. Objectives This review aimed to assess the effects of online interventions to reduce online hate speech/cyberhate. Search Methods We systematically searched 2 database aggregators. 36 individual databases. 6 individual journals. and 34 websites. as well as bibliographies of published reviews of related literature. and scrutiny of annotated bibliographies of related literature. Inclusion Criteria We included randomized and rigorous quasi-experimental studies of online hate speech/cyberhate interventions that measured the creation and/or consumption of hateful content online and included a control group. Eligible populations included youth (10-17 years) and adult (18+ years) participants of any racial/ethnic background. religious affiliation. gender identity. sexual orientation. nationality. or citizenship status. Data Collection and Analysis The systematic search covered January 1. 1990 to December 31. 2020. with searches conducted between August 19. 2020 and December 31. 2020. and supplementary searches undertaken between March 17 and 24. 2022. We coded characteristics of the intervention. sample. outcomes. and research methods. We extracted quantitative findings in the form of a standardized mean difference effect size. We computed a meta-analysis on two independent effect sizes. Main Results Two studies were included in the meta-analysis. one of which had three treatment arms. For the purposes of the meta-analysis we chose the treatment arm from the alvarez-Benjumea and Winter (2018) study that most closely aligned with the treatment condition in the Bodine-Baron et al. (2020) study. However. we also present additional single effect sizes for the other treatment arms from the alvarez-Benjumea and Winter (2018) study. Both studies evaluated the effectiveness of an online intervention for reducing online hate speech/cyberhate. The Bodine-Baron et al. (2020) study had a sample size of 1570 subjects. while the alvarez-Benjumea and Winter (2018) study had a sample size of 1469 tweets (nested in 180 subjects). The mean effect was small (g = -0.134. 95{\%} confidence interval [-0.321. -0.054]). Each study was assessed for risk of bias on the following domains: randomization process. deviations from intended interventions. missing outcome data. measurement of the outcome. and selection of the reported results. Both studies were rated as ""low risk"" on the randomization process. deviations from intended interventions. and measurement of the outcome domains. We assessed the Bodine-Baron et al. (2020) study as ""some"" risk of bias regarding missing outcome data and ""high risk"" for selective outcome reporting bias. The alvarez-Benjumea and Winter (2018) study was rated as ""some concern"" for the selective outcome reporting bias domain.Authors' Conclusions The evidence is insufficient to determine the effectiveness of online hate speech/cyberhate interventions for reducing the creation and/or consumption of hateful content online. Gaps in the evaluation literature include the lack of experimental (random assignment) and quasi-experimental evaluations of online hate speech/cyberhate interventions. addressing the creation and/or consumption of hate speech as opposed to the accuracy of detection/classification software. and assessing heterogeneity among subjects by including both"
260,The excitation energy transfer (ET) pathway and mechanism from an organic antenna to a lanthanide ion has been the subject of discussion for many decades. In the case of europium (Eu3+). it has been suggested that the transfer originates from the ligand singlet state or a triplet state. Taking the lanthanide complex Eu(TTA)3(H2O)2 as an example. we have investigated the spectra and luminescence kinetics. mainly at room temperature and 77 K. to acquire the necessary experimental data. We put forward an experimental and theoretical approach to measure the energy transfer rates from the antenna to different Eu3+ levels using the Dexter formulation. We find that transfer from the ligand singlet state to Eu3+ may account for the ET pathway. by combined electric dipole- electric dipole (ED-ED) and ED-electric quadrupole (EQ) mechanisms. The contributions from the triplet state by these mechanisms are very small. An independent systems rate equation approach can effectively model the experimental kinetics results. The model utilizes the cooperative processes that take place on the metal ion and ligand and considers S0. S1. and T1 ligand states in addition to 7F0.1. 5D0. 5D1. and 5DJ (=5L6. 5D3. 5D2 combined) Eu3+ states. The triplet exchange ET rate is estimated to be of the order 107 s-1. The observation of a nanosecond risetime for the Eu3+ 5D1 level does not enable the assignment of the ET route or the mechanism. Furthermore. the 5D1 risetime may be contributed by several processes. Observation of its temperature dependence and also that of the ground-state population can supply useful information concerning the mechanism because the change in metal-ion internal conversion rate has a greater effect than changes in singlet or triplet nonradiative rates. A critical comparison is included for the model of Malta employed in the online software LUMPAC and JOYSpectra. The theoretical treatment of the exchange mechanism and its contribution are now being considered. PU  - AMER CHEMICAL SOC PI  - WASHINGTON PA  - 1155 16TH ST. NW. WASHINGTON. DC 20036 USA
261,Semen analysis is currently performed by using two techniques. Visual assessment technique is manual observation based technique and strongly depends on the experiences of the observer. Therefore. the reliability of the results is skeptical. On the other hand. computer based expert systems are more consistent and reliable. However. they are very expensive systems. therefore. cannot be utilized in many laboratories. In this study. we proposed a hybrid expert system utilizing visual assessment environment with the computerized analyzing part to eliminate the disadvantages of each technique. In the proposed system. smartphone based data acquisition approach is used to provide more modular and practical expert system for the sperm analysis. The records are. then. transferred to the server to analyze by developed software. In this analyzing software. we proposed multistage hybrid analyzing approach in terms of video stabilization. sperm concentration and motility analysis. Each video was initially fixed by the Speed Up Robust Features based matching technique. Then. Kalman Filter was employed for sperm tracking. After tracking step. trajectories have been divided into 3 s length to prevent possible incorrect assignments due to sudden changes in sperm motions. In the experimental tests. we combined all trajectories obtained from a total of 18 videos of 6 different subjects. We clustered a total of 89438 trajectories into 4 cluster as fast progressive. progressive. non-progressive and immotile according to extracted seven features. In order to compare the results. we also analyzed the same semen sample in another expert system. SQA-Vision. The difference was measured 3.4{\%} and 4.8{\%} in the determination of total and motile sperm concentration. and 2.1{\%}. 7.4{\%}. 5.3{\%} for progressive. non-progressive and immotile movement type analysis respectively. The significance and impact of the proposed system are capability of reporting more detailed results in a variety of situations and having more advantages than any expert systems utilized for sperm analysis in terms of portability. cost and modularity. Additionally. to the best of our knowledge. this is the first study reporting use of the smartphone in an expert system for the sperm analysis in terms of data acquisition and result reporting.

262,A profound analysis of pressure and flow wave propagation in cardiovascular systems is the key in noninvasive assessment of hemodynamic parameters. Pulse transit time (PTT). which closely relates to the physical properties of the cardiovascular system. can be linked to variations of blood pressure and stroke volume to provide information for patient-specific clinical diagnostics. In this work. we present mathematical and numerical tools. capable of accurately predicting the PTT. local pulse wave velocity. vessel compliance. and pressure/flow waveforms. in a viscous hyperelastic cardiovascular network. A new one-dimensional framework. entitled cardiovascular flow analysis (CardioFAN). is presented to describe the pulsatile fluid-structure interaction in the hyperelastic arteries. where pertaining hyperbolic equations are solved using a high-resolution total variation diminishing Lax-Wendroff method. The computational algorithm is validated against well-known numerical. in vitro and in vivo data for networks of main human arteries with 55. 37 and 26 segments. respectively. PTT prediction is improved by accounting for hyperelastic nonlinear waves between two arbitrary sections of the arterial tree. Consequently. arterial compliance assignments at each segment are improved in a personalized model of the human aorta and supra-aortic branches with 26 segments. where prior in vivo data were available for comparison. This resulted in a 1.5{\%} improvement in overall predictions of the waveforms. or average relative errors of 5.5{\%} in predicting flow. luminal area and pressure waveforms compared to prior in vivo measurements. The open source software. CardioFAN. can be calibrated for arbitrary patient-specific vascular networks to conduct noninvasive diagnostics.

263,Software Defined Radio (SDR) technologies play today an important role in modern wireless networks due to their flexibility to implement re-configurable hardware designs. In light of the importance to operate and develop such technologies. academic programs in the communications engineering field demand an introduction to Digital Signal Processing (DSP) and SDR communication schemes accordingly. Typically. the teaching of this subject is afforded through projects and hands-on activities in classrooms. However. provided their relevance in the current state-of-the-art. this topic also provides a framework to teach soft skills concerning research abilities in students. This paper introduces an academic program to the development of SDR functionality as well as research skills based on exposure to state-of-the-art research. Through projects. hands-on activities are conducted to teach digital signal processing designs using Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology. The course aims to develop technical skills to implement communication system blocks. Besides. workshops and seminars are prepared to support the development of research and communication skills. The proposed course is flexible to incorporate on a given academic program as an elective subject to further support topics related to communication theory and discrete-time signals. Learning outcomes are designed to develop enhanced technical skills in SDR design and simultaneously a critical discussion of the devised solutions in light of the state-of-the-art. Also. skills related to identifying. formulating. and discussing engineering problems are further reinforced. Results from supported projects developed in the classroom exhibit completed assignments superior to 90{\%} of participant students. Learning objectives concerning the technical skills were successfully covered (90{\%}) in comparison to research and communicating skills (80{\%}). Additionally. research skills and the ability to disseminate knowledge gradually improved in seminars. Finally. results of the current course exhibit improvements of 25{\%} regarding the acquired skills in digital signal processing in comparison to previous courses.

264,Objective - To examine the role of academic librarians in online courses in a university setting.Design - Survey questionnaire.Setting - A multi-campus university in the southern United States.Subjects - Students. faculty. and librarians who had taken. taught. or assisted in fully online courses.Methods - Email addresses for potential survey participants were provided by the university office of institutional research. The researchers tailored survey questions weto specific subject groups. The surveys took roughly 15 minutes to complete and were open for 1 week following the original email. Surveys included 12 - 16 questions. depending on the version. and included questions relating to the use of librarians in online courses. the type of assistance they provided. and how assistance was provided (e.g.. in person. email. live chat). Question types included yes/no. check-all-that-apply. and open-ended-answer.Main Results - Of the student responders. 23.24{\%} reported asking a librarian for help with research or an assignment. This help included finding resources (34.48{\%}). database searching (28.57{\%}). and searching the library catalog (20.69{\%}). Help was given over email (28.03{\%}). live chat (31.82{\%}). and in person (17.42{\%}). which was reported to be most helpful by several students. Only 10.61{\%} reported using video-conferencing software such as Zoom.Only 5.88{\%} of faculty reported including a librarian for synchronous instruction in online courses. while 19.12{\%} made use of asynchronous tutorials created by a librarian. The majority of respondents (93.1{\%}) had not worked with an embedded librarian in their courses. and many reported not knowing that it was an option. Instead. faculty perceived librarians to be an outside resource.Both faculty members and students reported a desire for more video tutorials from librarians. Several faculty mentioned wanting a library module that could serve as an introduction to the library. library resources. and basic instruction topics such as citation styles.Conclusion - While some students and faculty have worked with librarians in online courses and welcomed their involvement. there is room for improvement in library outreach. including how the library communicates with and supports this growing population.

265,Currently. few studies are reported on the composition of microbiota in stroke patients and the association with stroke prognosis. This study investigated the differing microbiota composition in stroke patients and confirmed the association of microbiota composition with poor functional outcome. Between January of 2018 and December of 2019. 198 patients with acute cerebral infarction were included in this study. For the case-control study. age and sex-matched normal healthy subjects (n=200) were included when receiving their health screening examinations. We isolated bacterial extracellular membrane vesicles and extracted DNA from blood samples. Taxonomic assignments were performed by using the sequence reads of 16S rRNA genes following blood microbiota analysis. Statistical analysis was conducted appropriately by using Statistical Analysis System software. The mean age of the stroke patients were 63.7 +/- 12.5 years. and the male sex was 58.5{\%}. Of the total enrolled patients. poor functional outcome (modified Rankin Score {\textgreater}= 3) was noted in 19.7{\%}. The principal component analysis of microbiota composition revealed significant differences between healthy control subjects and stroke patients. At the genus level. Aerococcaceae(f). ZB2(c). TM7-1(c). and Flavobacterium were significantly increased in stroke patients compared to the healthy controls. whereas Mucispirillum. rc4-4. Akkermansia. Clostridiales(o). Lactobacillus. and Stenotrophomonas were decreased considerably. For the functional outcome after ischemic stroke. Anaerococcus. Blautia. Dialister. Aerococcaceae(f). Propionibacterium. Microbacteriaceae(f). and Rothia were enriched in the group with good outcomes. whereas Ruminococcaceae(f) and Prevotella were enriched in the group with poor outcome. There was apparent dysbiosis of blood microbiota in patients with acute ischemic stroke compared to healthy people. Ruminococcaceae(f) and Prevotella were elevated in stroke patients with poor functional outcome. PU  - NATURE RESEARCH PI  - BERLIN PA  - HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3. BERLIN. 14197. GERMANY
266,Objective. The precise localization of intracranial electrodes is a fundamental step relevant to the analysis of intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings in various fields. With the increasing development of iEEG studies in human neuroscience. higher requirements have been posed on the localization process. resulting in urgent demand for more integrated. easy-operation and versatile tools for electrode localization and visualization. With the aim of addressing this need. we develop an easy-to-use and multifunction toolbox called iEEGview. which can be used for the localization and visualization of human intracranial electrodes. Approach. iEEGview is written in Matlab scripts and implemented with a GUI. From the GUI. by taking only pre-implant MRI and post-implant CT images as input. users can directly run the full localization pipeline including brain segmentation. image co-registration. electrode reconstruction. anatomical information identification. activation map generation and electrode projection from native brain space into common brain space for group analysis. Additionally. iEEGview implements methods for brain shift correction. visual location inspection on MRI slices and computation of certainty index in anatomical label assignment. Main results. All the introduced functions of iEEGview work reliably and successfully. and are tested by images from 28 human subjects implanted with depth and/or subdural electrodes. Significance. iEEGview is the first public Matlab GUI-based software for intracranial electrode localization and visualization that holds integrated capabilities together within one pipeline. iEEGview promotes convenience and efficiency for the localization process. provides rich localization information for further analysis and offers solutions for addressing raised technical challenges. Therefore. it can serve as a useful tool in facilitating iEEG studies. PU  - IOP PUBLISHING LTD PI  - BRISTOL PA  - TEMPLE CIRCUS. TEMPLE WAY. BRISTOL BS1 6BE. ENGLAND

268,In this paper. the procedure for the strength evaluation of the piping system installed on liquefied natural gas (LNG) carriers is discussed. A procedure that accounts for the ship's wave load and hull motion acceleration (as well as the deformation due to the thermal expansion and contraction experienced by the hull during seafaring operations) is presented. The load due to the temperature and self-weight of the piping installed on the deck is also considered. Various operating and load conditions of the LNG piping system are analyzed. Stress analysis is performed by combining various conditions of sustained. occasional. and expansion loads. Stress is assessed using finite element analysis based on beam elements that represent the behavior of the piping. The attributes of the piping system components (such as valves. expansion joints. and supports) are represented in the finite element model while CAESAR-II. a commercial software is used for finite element analysis. Component modeling. load assignment. and load combinations are presented to evaluate pipe stresses under various load conditions. An evaluation model is selected for the piping arrangement of LNG and the evaluated stress is compared with the allowable stress defined by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

269,"Meta-analyses on the effect of peer tutoring have rarely examined the effect of peer tutoring on tutors' academic gain. Some previous analyses are dated and have methodological or theoretical limitations. Hence. there is a compelling need to fill this gap by conducting an updated and comprehensive meta-analysis for identifying certain determinants of best practices for peer tutoring on tutors' academic achievement in the present study. Additionally. role theory and equity theory in peer tutoring were tested. The present meta-analytic study examined 16 articles using The comprehensive meta-analysis software programme and SPSS macro for analyses. It was found that the weighted mean effect size was 0.43 (p {\textless} 0.001). Moreover. the crucial parameters for optimizing the effectiveness of peer tutoring interventions are identified as follows: Tutees with low academic ability, tutors coming from secondary school, fewer tutor training sessions per week, shorter tutor training time per session, choosing mathematics as subject content, random assignment of tutees and tutors, structured peer tutoring, same-age non-reciprocal peer tutoring, same-sex dyad grouping, and more weekly tutoring sessions but longer tutoring time for each session.

270,"Given a set of constraints F and a user-defined weight function W on the assignment space. the problem of constrained sampling is to sample satisfying assignments of F conditioned on W. Constrained sampling is a fundamental problem with applications in probabilistic reasoning. synthesis. software and hardware testing. Consequently. the problem of sampling has been subject to intense theoretical and practical investigations over the years. Despite such intense investigations. there still remains a gap between theory and practice. In particular. there has been significant progress in the development of sampling techniques when W is a uniform distribution. but such techniques fail to handle general weight functions W. Furthermore. we are. often. interested in Sigma(1)(1) formulas. i.e.. G(X) := there exists Y F(X. Y) for some F, typically the set of variables Y are introduced as auxiliary variables during encoding of constraints to F. In this context. one wonders whether it is possible to design sampling techniques whose runtime performance is agnostic to the underlying weight distribution and can handle Sigma(1)(1) formulas?The primary contribution of this work is a novel technique. called WAPS. for sampling over Sigma(1)(1) whose runtime is agnostic to W. WAPS is based on our recently discovered connection between knowledge compilation and uniform sampling. WAPS proceeds by compiling F into a well studied compiled form. d-DNNF. which allows sampling operations to be conducted in linear time in the size of the compiled form. We demonstrate that WAPS can significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art weighted and projected sampler WeightGen. by up to 3 orders of magnitude in runtime while achieving a geometric speedup of 296x and solving 564 more instances out of 773. The distribution generated by WAPS is statistically indistinguishable from that generated by an ideal weighted and projected sampler. Furthermore. WAPS is almost oblivious to the number of samples requested. PU  - SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG PI  - CHAM PA  - GEWERBESTRASSE 11. CHAM. CH-6330. SWITZERLAND"

This paper focuses on controller load balancing using packet-in request redirection. that is. given the instantaneous state of the system. determining whether to redirect packet-in requests for each switch. such that the overall control plane response time (CPRT) is minimized. To address the above problem. we propose a framework based on Lyapunov optimization. First. we use the drift-plus-penalty algorithm to combine CPRT minimization problem with controller capacity constraints. and further derive a non-linear program. whose optimal solution is obtained with brute force using standard linearization techniques. Second. we present a greedy strategy to efficiently obtain a solution with a bounded approximation ratio. Third. we reformulate the program as a problem of maximizing a non-monotone submodular function subject to matroid constraints. We implement a controller prototype for packet-in request redirection. and conduct trace-driven simulations to validate our theoretical results. The results show that our algorithms can reduce the average CPRT by 81.6{\%} compared to static assignment. and achieve a 3x improvement in maximum controller capacity violation ratio.

272,"Many metagenomic and environmental DNA studies require the taxonomic assignment of individual reads or sequences by aligning reads to a reference database. known as taxonomic binning. When a read aligns to more than one reference sequence. it is often classified based on sequence similarity. This step can assign reads to incorrect taxa. at a rate which depends both on the assignment algorithm and on underlying population genetic and database parameters. In particular. as we move towards using environmental DNA to study eukaryotic taxa subject to regular recombination. we must take into account issues concerning gene tree discordance. Though accuracy is often compared across algorithms using a fixed data set. the relative impact of these population genetic and database parameters on accuracy has not yet been quantified. Here. we develop both a theoretical and simulation framework in the simplified case of two reference species. and compute binning accuracy over a wide range of parameters. including sequence length. species-query divergence time. divergence times of the reference species. reference database completeness. sample age and effective population size. We consider two assignment methods and contextualize our results using parameters from a recent ancient environmental DNA study. comparing them to the commonly used discriminative k-mer-based method Clark (Current Biology. 31. 2021. 2728, BMC Genomics. 16. 2015. 1). Our results quantify the degradation in assignment accuracy as the samples diverge from their closest reference sequence. and with incompleteness of reference sequences. We also provide a framework in which others can compute expected accuracy for their particular method or parameter set. Code is available at . PU  - WILEY PI  - HOBOKEN PA  - 111 RIVER ST.

274,"Computing theory is an important part of computer science education. introducing students to computational models of increasing power to study possibilities and limitations of computation. The subject is. however. very abstract and mathematical. and students often struggle with it. Students must master various computational models. but there is often a lengthy delay from the time a model is introduced until a student gets feedback on their related assignment. During this time. the course has typically moved far ahead. and students become progressively more lost. To alleviate this problem. we developed a prototype of an automated feedback tool for CS theory. which extends the widely used JFLAP software. Our tool currently handles student submissions of deterministic and non-deterministic finite automata. regular expressions. context-free grammars. and push-down automata homework. where an instructor specifies the target language and the students receive immediate feedback on their submissions. Currently. for incorrect submissions. the feedback is in the form of a ""witness"" string. specifying a string on which the submission fails. Beyond regular languages. our tool attempts to solve undecidable problems, fortunately. the undecidability does not occur on typical homework assignments. We are collecting preliminary evaluation data from students using the prototype tool in their course. In our future work. we will analyze the data. and we aim to produce automated partial credit (along with the witness feedback) using SAT and QBF solvers.

275,"Recently. many approaches were proposed to support human resource management in finding the best human resources for available jobs. However. existing solutions do not effectively evaluate employees' skills. or they do only partially. neither provide mechanisms to describe subjects' skills and desiderata. To face this issue. this paper proposes a decision model for assisting human resource management in effectively evaluating the degree of mutual satisfaction in job-employee assignments. In particular. the decision model has been devised with the following core characteristics: i) employees' skills are modeled by combining hard skills (e.g.: academic training and competencies) and soft skills (e.g.: socio-relational experiences), ii) employees' soft skills are self-evaluated. giving importance not so much to experiences possessed but rather how such skills have been applied over time, iii) employees and managers can self-evaluate their preferences to enable the achievement of the optimal allocation by maximizing the global mutual satisfaction iv) partial matches between characteristics and desires of both employees and jobs are measured through a set of tailored fuzzy metrics. The proposed decision model has been validated in a real case to support the allocation of newly hired employees among open job positions in a Public Administration. Results showed an adequate ability of the proposed model both to support the description of employees. skills. jobs and preferences. and to suggest the best allocation maximizing the global mutual satisfaction. Summarizing. a decision model for human resource management with innovative characteristics is proposed and used to support decisions for a real allocation problem.

276,Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the degree of satisfaction and perceived relevance of the Graduate Business Education (GBE) programme at the University of Botswana.Design/methodology/approach - A self-administered questionnaire and face to face interviews were used to collect data from Master of Business Administration (MBA) participants on their reason for studying MBA. level of satisfaction. and the extent to which the skills and experiences obtained correlate with those required by the corporate world. The data were analyzed using simple descriptive statistics.Findings - The majority of the respondents are male adults attending part time MBA classes and working full time in administrative positions in the public and private sectors. The study found that improved managerial skills. career development and broader business insights are major reasons for joining the MBA programme. while employability and economic gains were ranked low as driving forces. Even though the overall satisfaction with the programme is mixed and inconclusive. the MBA programme has assisted participants to develop basic management and administration skills. However. the programme puts greater emphasis on conceptual. technical and analytical skills than on problem solving. innovation. communication and entrepreneurial skills which are perceived to be most needed by employers. implying a relevance gap. What the MBA participants learnt does not correlate with what they perceived to be most needed by employers.Research limitations/implications - Since the findings are based on perceptions of MBA participants. the conclusions drawn from these findings must be considered tentative and interpreted with care. Future research must include representative sample of all MBA stakeholders such as faculty. students. graduates. employers and administrators to get rich information about quality of inputs. processes and products of MBA programme.Practical implications - There is strong need for the MBA programme to integrate traditional management and administrative skills with experiences and skills relevant for today's world of work. Bridging the growing theory-practice gap requires attracting professors with practical business experience. revising staff recruitment policies and procedures. establishing formal partnership with external organization. and develop long-term strategies to reduce teaching load and staff turnover.Originality/value - Most of the studies on the relevance and quality of GBE programmes are conducted in western higher education institutions. very little has been done in African universities. This is the first of its kind in the context of Botswana. an important contribution to existing literature and foundation for further advanced studies in the area.

277,The manufacturing cell formation represents one of the important stages of the construction of cellular manufacturing systems. It focuses on grouping machines. parts and workers and assigning them to the corresponding cells. This assignment is guided by multiple objectives. and is subject to many constraints. In this paper. the focus is made on a variant of the cell formation problem. which is the Generalized Cubic Cell Formation Problem (GCCFP). In this study. a mathematical model is developed for this variant of the problem. Besides the multiple objectives considered in most research works. the quality index of the produced parts is also considered in this study. To solve the problem. a Discrete Flower Pollination Algorithm (DFPA) is developed. To validate the model and the DFPA. a set of randomly generated instances were solved using B{\&}B under LINGO software. DFPA and Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm. The performance of DFPA. from the standpoint of the considered objectives and the time of calculation. has been tested. The experiment results show the efficiency of the developed method.

278,This article takes the discipline of knowledge management in organizations and applies it to the academic library setting. Knowledge management studies inefficiencies in information sharing within organizations and proposes solutions. In the academic library. the one-shot library instruction session is largely inadequate in teaching students how to use library databases. particularly for advanced assignments. Follow-up contact such as workshops or individual instruction sessions requires time and initiative from students. and this contact very often does not occur. This denies students the opportunity to experience much of the crucial subject knowledge of the librarian. This kind of unshared subject librarian knowledge corresponds to a key concept of knowledge management called tacit knowledge. Tacit knowledge refers to both knowledge that is unshared in an organization as well as knowledge that is difficult to document and transmit. Social media platforms and course software such as LibGuides may offer a solution to enhancing librarian-student teaching. but only if the resource contains a significant amount of previously tacit knowledge (tutorials. links to explanatory reference material. course-specific search strategies. and more). A key goal for librarians should be sharing and making easily accessible previously undocumented subject-specific knowledge. This article evaluates different ways of sharing knowledge using LibGuides and social media. and how well these forms respond to the information-seeking behavior of students.

279,In many social science experiments. subjects often interact with each other and as a result one unit's treatment influences the outcome of another unit. Over the last decade. a significant progress has been made toward causal inference in the presence of such interference between units. Researchers have shown that the two-stage randomization of treatment assignment enables the identification of average direct and spillover effects. However. much of the literature has assumed perfect compliance with treatment assignment. In this article. we establish the nonparametric identification of the complier average direct and spillover effects in two-stage randomized experiments with interference and noncompliance. In particular. we consider the spillover effect of the treatment assignment on the treatment receipt as well as the spillover effect of the treatment receipt on the outcome. We propose consistent estimators and derive their randomization-based variances under the stratified interference assumption. We also prove the exact relationships between the proposed randomization-based estimators and the popular two-stage least squares estimators. The proposed methodology is motivated by and applied to our own randomized evaluation of India's National Health Insurance Program (RSBY). where we find some evidence of spillover effects. The proposed methods are implemented via an open-source software package.for this article. including a standardized description of the materials available for reproducing the work. are available as an online supplement.

280,In this paper. downlink joint codebook assignment. user association. and power allocation for a sparse code Multiple access (SCMA)-based systems in cloud radio access network (C-RAN) are considered. The principal point of this paper is to achieve a resource allocation to accomplish the minimum total system transmit power subject to SCMA restriction. total available power in radio remote head (RRH). fronthual limitation. and quality of service (QoS) prerequisites for each user with low complexity algorithm. To solve the recommended optimization problem an iterative algorithm considering successive convex approximation (SCA) is utilized. Subsequently. the main problem is separated into two subproblems of joint codebook assignment and user association and power allocation. By intelligently defining user association constraint. subproblem of the joint codebook assignment and user association is converted to integer Linear programming (ILP) and solved with available online software such as CVX. Also. to solve the power allocation subproblem successive convex approximation with low complexity (SCALE) is used. Furthermore in this paper we study the effect of the channel state information (CSI) estimation on system model performance. In the simulation results. the adequacy of the recommended solution to minimize total system transmit power is shown and compared to the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and the orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) in C-RAN.

282,"Study objective: To estimate the prevalence of unscheduled absences in a cohort of certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs) over a 3-year period. for purposes of critiquing statistical review of individual providers relative to potential identification of patterns of such absences.Design: Retrospective. observational study.Setting: University hospital.Subjects: 99 CRNAs performing clinical assignments in the operating rooms.Interventions: None.Measurements: CRNA daily clinical assignments and unscheduled absences were retrieved from the department's staff assignment software package. Data were extracted and analyzed to estimate the prevalence of unscheduled absences by CRNAs by day of the week. and whether each absence occurred on the workday before or after either a holiday or a personal vacation. A statistical power analysis was performed to determine the number of workdays of data required to identify outlier personnel above the 95th percentile among all CRNAs while controlling for a family-wise error rate of 5{\%}.Main results: The overall incidence of unscheduled absences pooled by days was 1.7{\%}. with small differences among days of the week. and before or after vacations. A year of data would be required to detect outliers for unscheduled absences exceeding the 95{\%} upper confidence limit among all CRNAs. Attempting to identify patterns of absences being on specific days of the week or as related to holidays and vacations would require multiple years of data.Conclusions: OR managers can detect CRNAs with excessive numbers of unscheduled absences. but at least a year of data is required. Detecting apparent ""patterns"" of absences would require multiple years of data and is thus impractical. PU  - ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC PI  - NEW YORK PA  - 360 PARK AVE SOUTH. NEW YORK.

283,Software-based training supports maintenance or recovery of cognitive abilities. However. regular use needs a high self-motivation. For this. the individual needs of users should be taken into account during the development process. Thus. in this work. two possibilities for tailoring in combination of application. and media devices in practice are investigated in an explorative between-subject design and hypothesis-generating study (N = 68). First. the effect of a browser-based training without gamification or with assignment of gamification appropriate to mean user characteristic on training duration is investigated. Second. the effect of this training and a subsequent serious game app on perception and possible combinations of different media is investigated. The results of behavior lead to the hypothesis that with tailored gamification in browsers. users may train longer in the middle range of training duration. The results of perception show a significant difference and higher perceived value/usefulness and overall rating. as well as the assumption of a higher effect in computer and mobile training in the group with tailored gamification. This could therefore provide a basis for combinations. A combination of both usage scenarios is perceived by users as most reasonable for a positive training effect. Nevertheless. there is a high variance for self-assessed usage. Thus. the results support developing multiple combinable scenarios. tailored to the user. in media devices and game integration to address intended effects. development and user needs to support the effect of cognitive software training in practice.

The paper presents ideas for implementation of practical and experimental project assignments. student engagement and collaboration. The paper also presents the results of authors after applying this approach to one generation of students. The application access with practical assignments gave markedly better results. measured through student engagement. classroom attendance and distribution of student results. In this manner. the students had a better understanding of the basics of the microcontrollers. sensors. IoT and were willing to engage in programming of microcontrollers at the lower level.

286,Software Engineering and Computer Science (CS) programs often contain several mathematical courses or courses with large mathematics components or dependencies. Study success in those subjects can be influenced by students' attitudes towards mathematics and their perceptions about their own relation with mathematics. To gain insights into how the mathematics perceptions of computer science students affect their studies. we collected qualitative data from fourteen CS students from two universities in the context of an elective mathematics course. In this qualitative research. we used a triangulation strategy by collecting data from three different sources (interviews. questionnaires. and math-history assignments) to develop a comprehensive understanding of CS students' mathematics perceptions. The thematic analysis revealed the factors that affect students' perceptions about mathematics. including various types of prior experiences. their self-efficacy. math anxiety. and motivation sources. The analysis also highlighted that students find mathematics important for skill transfer to specific CS topics and for supporting continuous learning. PU  - IEEE PI  - NEW YORK PA  - 345 E 47TH ST.

287,This review covers recent developments in glycosamino-glycan (GAG) analysis via mass spectrometry (MS). GAGs participate in a variety of biological functions. including cellular communication. wound healing. and anticoagulation. and are important targets for structural characterization. GAGs exhibit a diverse range of structural features due to the variety of O- and N-sulfation modifications and uronic acid C-5 epimerization that can occur. making their analysis a challenging target. Mass spectrometry approaches to the structure assignment of GAGs have been widely investigated. and new methodologies remain the subject of development. Advances in sample preparation. tandem MS techniques (MS/MS). online separations. and automated analysis software have advanced the field of GAG analysis. These recent developments have led to remarkable improvements in the precision and time efficiency for the structural characterization of GAGs.

288,ROS (Robot Operating System) is currently the most popular robotic software development framework. Robotic software in safe-critical domain are usually subject to hard realtime constraints. so designers must formally model and analyze their timing behaviors to guarantee that real-time constraints are always honored at runtime. This paper studies real-time scheduling and analysis of processing chains in ROS2. the second-generation ROS with a major consideration of real-time capability. First. we study response time analysis of processing chains on ROS2 executors. We show that the only existing result of this problem is both optimistic and pessimistic. and develop new techniques to address these problems and significantly improve the analysis precision. Second. we reveal that the response time of a processing chain on an executor only depends on its last scheduling entity (callback). which provides useful guidance for designers to improve not only the response time bound. but also the actual worst-case/average response time of the system at little design cost. We conduct experiments with both randomly generated workload and a case study on realistic ROS2 platforms to evaluate and demonstrate our results.

289,"Pedigrees have a long history in classical genetics. agronomics. evolutionary ecology. and ex situ captive breeding. Use of molecular techniques has expanded the variety of species for which pedigrees can be constructed. However. molecular pedigrees almost exclusively consider microsatellite loci. despite advances in high-throughput sequencing allowing development of genomic marker sets in nearly any organism. Here we generate a novel set of genomic SNPs derived from ddRAD sequencing in two populations of Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) and describe the diversity and differentiation between them. We then compare and contrast parentage assignment rates and accuracy in one population that has been the subject of long-term monitoring. Specifically. we consider pedigrees constructed using two sets of markers (microsatellites and SNPs). two pedigree construction software (CERVUS than Sequoia). as well as varying the groupings of candidate parents (either all individuals simultaneously. only individuals born before a focal year. or only individuals known to have survived to a focal year). ddRAD sequencing returned between 1568 and 3240 loci depending on whether both populations were considered simultaneously or individually. Parentage assignment rates were always higher using CERVUS than Sequoia. with the latter at times either not assigning parentage or creating ""inferred parents"". In all cases. ""polarizing"" the datasets (e.g.. including year of birth) significantly improved assignments. This represents one of the first direct comparisons of pedigree construction using different markers in the same set of individuals. and the SNPs described here will be a resource for continued pedigree construction. and future research in Weddell seals.

292,"Students often approach biochemistry with a degree of trepidation with many considering it one of the more difficult subjects. This is. in part. due to the necessity of making visual images of submicroscopic concepts. Molecular interactions underpin most biological processes, therefore. mastering these concepts is essential. Understanding the forces and mechanisms that underpin protein-ligand interactions is a key learning goal for mastering the protein structure-function relationship. We intended to overcome such learning barriers by implementing assignment-based activities across three successive biochemistry cohorts. The activities involved 3D printed proteins and cheminformatics/molecular modeling software activities which had the advantage of targeting students' visual-spatial ability. Learning activities. conducted in small groups. were specifically designed to enhance understanding of the protein structure-function relationship through a detailed analysis of molecular-level interactions between proteins and ligands. Here we describe the methodology for preparation of the learning tools and how they were incorporated in the learning exercises in the form of both formative and summative assessments. We compared their perceived effectiveness via student feedback surveys conducted over three consecutive cohorts. Survey results showed students were positively engaged with these technologies with a slight preference for cheminformatics. From an instructor's perspective. we found significantly improved overall grade averages for the subjects following implementation of the assignments which may suggest these tools contributed to enhanced understanding. While print resolution could not match that of cheminformatics software. we present evidence to support their continued incorporation in the course.

Dependency Injection frameworks support designers and developers in the automated management of components lifecycle. binding them to predefined scopes. thus delegating to an outer and independent participant the responsibility of creation. destruction and inter-dependencies definition of runtime instances.

They allow monitoring the single activity of different people working in the same project through all the project's lifetime. Thus. Version Control Systems are also used by educational institutions. The aim of this work is to demonstrate that the academic success in Computer Sciences subjects may be predicted by monitoring students' interaction with a Version Control System. In order to do so. we have built a prediction model by using Model Evaluator. a tool which allows evaluating several Machine Learning models in order to select the most suitable for a specific problem. A set of experiments are being been carried out to evaluate the prediction model. At those experiments. students of different subjects of the degree in Computer Science of the University of Leon were involved. All the selected subjects: Operating Systems Extension. Computer Programming. and Computer Organization. require students to complete practical assignments which imply developing software solutions in different programming languages.

295,Release is a ubiquitous concept in software development. referring to grouping multiple independent changes into a deliverable piece of software. Mining releases can help developers understand the software evolution at coarse grain. identify which features were delivered or bugs were fixed. and pinpoint who contributed on a given release. A typical initial step of release mining consists of identifying which commits compose a given release. We could find two main strategies used in the literature to perform this task: time-based and range-based. Some release mining works recognize that those strategies are subject to misclassifications but do not quantify the impact of such a threat. This paper analyzed 13.419 releases and 1.414.997 commits from 100 relevant open-source projects hosted at GitHub to assess both strategies in terms of precision and recall. We observed that. in general. the range-based strategy has superior results than the time-based strategy. Nevertheless. even when the range-based strategy is in place. some releases still show misclassifications.

296,Background Clinical trial articles often lack detailed descriptions of the methods used to randomize participants. conceal allocation. and blind subjects and investigators to group assignment. We describe our systematic approach to implement and measure blinding success in a double-blind phase 2 randomized controlled trial testing the efficacy of acupuncture for the treatment of vulvodynia. Methods Randomization stratified by vulvodynia subtype is managed by Research Electronic Data Capture software's randomization module adapted to achieve complete masking of group allocation. Subject and acupuncturist blinding assessments are conducted multiple times to identify possible correlates of unblinding. Results At present. 48 subjects have been randomized and completed the protocol resulting in 87 subject and 206 acupuncturist blinding assessments. Discussion Our approach to blinding and blinding assessment has the potential to improve our understanding of unblinding over time in the presence of possible clinical improvement.

297,The decoupling of data plane and control plane. which is the key feature of Software-Defined Networking (SDN). introduces considerable communication overhead between controllers and switches. Multiple distributed controllers are introduced in the control plane to improve the scalability and reliability of SDN. Controller placement problem and controller-switch mapping assignment problem are two of most critical challenges in multi-controller SDN. In this paper. we study the dynamic controller-switch mapping assignment problem for SDN. so as to minimize the average event response time from switches. We build the model in a generic way that can be used in both static and dynamic policies. The controller-switch mapping assignment procedure is formulated as a nonlinear integer programming problem. Due to the high cost of brute force and the locality of other heuristic algorithms in solving the formulated problem. we develop a genetic algorithm to solve the problem. Under the assumption that each controller subjects an M/M/1 queuing system. we simulate the proposed genetic algorithm in a static example of the model. Simulation results reveal that the proposed algorithm minimizes the average response time of events while incurring low computational overhead.

298,Release is a ubiquitous concept in software development. referring to grouping multiple independent changes into a deliverable piece of software. Mining releases can help developers understand the software evolution at coarse grain. identify which features were delivered or bugs were fixed. and pinpoint who contributed on a given release. A typical initial step of release mining consists of identifying which commits compose a given release. We could find two main strategies used in the literature to perform this task: time-based and range-based. Some release mining works recognize that those strategies are subject to misclassifications but do not quantify the impact of such a threat. This paper analyzed 13.419 releases and 1.414.997 commits from 100 relevant open source projects hosted at GitHub to assess both strategies in terms of precision and recall. We observed that. in general. the range-based strategy has superior results than the time-based strategy. Nevertheless. even when the range-based strategy is in place. some releases still show misclassifications. Thus. our paper also discusses some situations in which each strategy degrades. potentially leading to bias on the mining results if not adequately known and avoided.

299,Assigning class responsibility is a design decision to be made early in the design phase in software development. which bridges requirements and an analysis model. In general. assigning class responsibility relies heavily on the expertise and experience of the developer. and it is often ad-hoc. Class responsibility assignment rules are hard to be uniformly defined across the various domains of systems. Thus. the existing work describes general stepwise guidelines without concrete methods. which imposes the limit in deriving an analysis model from requirements specification without any loss of information and providing sufficient quality of the analysis model. This study tried to grasp the commonality and variations in analyzing the business application domain. By narrowing the subject of the solution. the presented patterns can help identify and assign class responsibilities for a system belonging to the business application domain. The presented pattern language consists of six segmented patterns. including 19 variations of relationship type among conceptual classes. Each sequence of a use case specification could be analyzed as the result of weaving a set of the six segmented patterns. A case study with a payroll system is presented to prove the patterns' feasibility. explaining how the proposed patterns can develop an analysis model. The coverage of the proposing CRA patterns and enhancement of implementation code quality is discussed as the benefit.

300,This Innovate Practice Full Paper presents our experience with teaching a cybersecurity course to undergraduate students utilizing terminal sessions recording software as a pedagogical tool.Developing a practical cybersecurity course demands numerous amount of preparation and the deployment of various security tools. One of the significant benefits of providing hands-on assignments is the opportunity for students to practice and experiment with tools similar to the ones used by both the professionals and malicious actors.This paper presents an innovative approach to conducting interactive demonstrations in the classroom and as a supplement to the weekly practical assignments. By combining two simple opensource software. we managed to create several short tutorials on how to use various command-line security tools. The educational tool was deployed in an undergraduate cybersecurity class. and the results from the anonymous online survey were overwhelmingly positive. Furthermore. the participants responded that the demos improved their understanding of the subject content and enabled them to learn the material effectively.

301,We have designed an anti-plagiarism software to detect plagiarism in students' assignments. especially written assignments. homework. and research reports. which will hereinafter be collectively referred to as student work. We used our university network to gather student work to detect plagiarism. . To collect data. we used a domain name system to store the student work data based on the respective location. time. and the subject on which each student was assigned work. Once the student work data were collected. they were sent to an extraction module to remove unwanted data. The remaining data were then fed to a similarity index module. which produced similarity values based on comparisons between the collected data and the student work. This module uses mathematical equations that are built using semantic and syntactic similarity reports. Furthermore. in this study. we recommended procedures that can be applied to avoid plagiarism using the programming approach. This approach can raise awareness of plagiarism among students and encourage them to generate innovative ideas instead of plagiarizing. To attract faculty members to use the software. promotional materials can be customized based on the actual control factors that directly affect their adoption of the software. For example. the campaign should provide information highlighting the ease of implementation of the software for senior faculty members.

302,"Undergraduate computer-aided design (CAD) courses can have large enrollments. making it difficult for instructors to thoroughly assess each student's assignments and provide individualized feedback. While in some subject areas textbook companies are developing online platforms that adapt problem sets to meet each individual student's needs. there has been apparently little attention to the area of individualized CAD instruction. This paper presents a program that compares students' two-dimensional CAD drawings to a solution. computes the number of missing or erroneous features in each student's drawing. and generates a visual comparison of each student's drawing with the solution. The system is implemented both as an offline version for batch processing and an online version for immediate student feedback on assignments. While the system lacks the ""smartness"" of a human grader. the offline version substantially reduces time spent grading exams and improves grading accuracy and consistency. and the online version encourages students to focus on important details of drawing and provides immediate online feedback for students as they complete assignments. as well as providing after-the-fact feedback on exams.

303,"Bug assignment is the task of ranking candidate developers in terms of their potential competence to fix a bug report. Numerous methods have been developed to address this task. relying on different methodological assumptions and demonstrating their effectiveness with a variety of empirical studies with numerous data sets and evaluation criteria. Despite the importance of the subject and the attention it has received from researchers. there is still no unanimity on how to validate and comparatively evaluate bug-assignment methods and. often times. methods reported in the literature are not reproducible.In this paper. we first report on our systematic review of the broad bug-assignment research field. Next. we focus on a few key empirical studies and review their choices with respect to three important experimental-design parameters. namely. the evaluation metric(s) they report. their definition of who the real assignee is. and the community of developers they consider as candidate assignees.The substantial variability on these criteria led us to formulate a systematic experiment to explore the impact of these choices. We conducted our experiment on a comprehensive data set of bugs we collected from 13 long-term open-source projects. using a simple Tf-IDf similarity metric. On the basis of our arguments and/or experiments. we provide useful guidelines for performing further bug-assignment research. We conclude that mean average precision (MAP) is the most informative evaluation metric. the developer community should be defined as ""all the project members."" and the real assignee should be defined as ""any developer who worked toward fixing a bug.""

304,Pair learning (PL) in robotics education is derived from pair programming. and impacted by many factors. Two important factors were identified including roles assignment and learning styles in this study. The roles assignment involved Driver-Navigator Pair and Software-Hardware Pair. For the learning style. the dimension of active/reflective was adopted. Therefore. a 2*3 factorial design was employed with the between-subjects factors roles assignment and learning styles. After a one-semester robotics course. we evaluated 66 fifth-grade students' learning achievements. attitude towards robotics. engagement. mental efforts. compatibility. and attitude towards PL. The results indicated that there was no statistically significant difference among different pairs in the above six indicators. Moreover. there was no significant difference in the learning outcomes among pairs of different learning styles. One important explanation is that the joint effect of PL might bridge the difference in learning performance that may be caused by learning style.

305,Legal contracts specify obligations and powers among legal subjects. involve assets. and are subject to quality constraints. Smart contracts are software systems that monitor the execution of contracts to ensure compliance. As a starting point for developing software engineering concepts. tools. and techniques for smart contracts. we have proposed Symboleo. a formal specification language for contracts. The complexity of real-life contracts (e.g.. in the construction and transportation industries) requires specification languages to support execution-time operations for contracts. such as subcontracting. assignment. delegation. and substitution. This paper formalizes such concepts by proposing for them a syntax and axiomatic semantics within Symboleo. This formalization makes use of primitive operations that support the transfer or sharing of right. responsibility. and performance among contracting and subcontracting parties. A prototype compliance checking tool for Symboleo has also been created to support monitoring compliance for contracts that include subcontracting aspects. A realistic freight contract specified in Symboleo is provided as an illustrative example for our proposal. and is used for a preliminary evaluation with positive results.

While computer-science lessons emphasize algorithm complexity. technological problems are usually neglected although they may significantly affect the performance in terms of wall time. As the technological problems are best explained by hands-on experience. we present a set of homework assignments focused on a range of technologies from instruction-level parallelism to GPU programming to cluster computing.

307,Objective: This study compares two maps of biomedical sciences using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) term co-assignments versus MeSH terms of citing/cited articles and reveals similarities and differences between the two approaches.Methods: MeSH terms assigned to 397.475 journal articles published in 2015. as well as their 4.632.992 cited references. were retrieved from Web of Science and MEDLINE databases. respectively. which formed over 7 million MeSH co-assignments and nearly 18 million direct citation pairs. We generated six network visualizations of biomedical science at three levels using Gephi software based on these MeSH co-assignments and citation pairs.Results: The MeSH co-assignment map contained more nodes and edges. as MeSH co-assignments cover all medical topics discussed in articles. By contrast. the MeSH citation map contained fewer but larger nodes and wider edges. as citation links indicate connections to two similar medical topics.Conclusion: These two types of maps emphasize different aspects of biomedical sciences. with MeSH co-assignment maps focusing on the relationship between topics in different categories and MeSH direct citation maps providing insights into relationships between topics in the same or similar category.

309,Full-time non-tenure track faculty. commonly referred to as NTT faculty. are increasingly utilized in higher education and shoulder much of the teaching load within academic institutions. Self-determination theory (SDT) has shown promise as a conceptual frame for characterizing the relationship between environmental support factors and NTT faculty satisfaction. Full-time NTT faculty were sampled nationwide (N = 3.527) to investigate an SDT-based model positing basic psychological needs (i.e.. volitional autonomy and relatedness) as mediators between six environmental support indices and NTT faculty satisfaction (i.e.. teaching/service and global satisfaction). Structural equation model results showed volitional autonomy and relatedness fully mediated the relationships between the six environmental supports and both indices of faculty satisfaction. Results highlight the utility of basic psychological needs in understanding the relationships between the environment and NTT faculty satisfaction.

310,Research on academic expatriation has rarely investigated the drivers of academic performance in a foreign cultural environment. This study focuses on research productivity as a crucial facet of performance and integral part of academic jobs. Drawing from the job demands-resources model. we position perceived organizational support and the number of doctoral students supervised as resources and teaching and service load as demands of self-initiated expatriate (SIE) academics' jobs. Most importantly. we suggest that being cross-culturally adjusted is a vital personal resource living and working in a foreign country and that cross-cultural adjustment moderates the effects of demands and resources. The analysis of combined survey and publication data from 208 SIE academics in natural sciences indicates that the number of doctoral students supervised increases research productivity. while teaching load reduces it. Moreover. findings show that cross-cultural adjustment amplifies the effects of demands and resources. The implications of these findings are discussed. PU  - WILEY PERIODICALS.

311,This paper presents a teaching case of a Blended Learning (DL) approach that was applied to a course on Method Engineering (ME) intended for graduate Business Informatics (BIS) students. The main reason for transforming a Master course on ME from traditional to blended is to take advantage of combining frontal instruction with e-learning based instruction and at the same time reducing lecturers' workload in times of increasing student numbers in BIS and Computer Science (CS) areas. The BL approach consists of three parts. as it consists of the introduction of computer-supported peer assessment. interactive e-lectures. and digital examination. The approach has been reflected upon by course lecturers themselves and it was evaluated through two separate student surveys. from which a variety of positive outcomes can be deduced. Increased generation of feedback. an increase in student motivation. and improved understanding of the course content are three of these outcomes that stand out. On top of student related advantages. especially the BE parts concerning peer assessment and digital examination reduce teaching load. These findings are informative for both education researchers and instructors who are interested in embedding BE in BIS or CS education. PU  - IEEE PI  - NEW YORK PA  - 345 E 47TH ST. NEW YORK.

312,Faculty members are increasingly recognizing the value of integrating high impact practices. such as undergraduate research. into the college experience. In this paper. I argue that one way of getting undergraduate students involved in political science research is to develop undergraduate research labs. wherein a small group of undergraduate students works collaboratively with a faculty member to carry out the research process from start to finish. I focus on how to develop and operate research labs at small to mid-sized institutions. I provide an overview of how I organized and conducted an undergraduate research lab and illustrate how the lab worked by describing a project that my lab recently carried out. I also describe how political science research labs can benefit students and political science programs. I end by reflecting on what I learned along the way. which I hope will be helpful to others who are considering developing similar experiences. Overall. I encourage other political scientists to develop undergraduate research labs but argue that. given the high teaching loads at many institutions. faculty should operate research labs as classes so that they count as part of one's teaching load.

313,"University lecturers worldwide had to adopt to online teaching at very short notice due to restrictions related to COVID-19. This is a particular challenge for social sciences research methods education. which often requires face-to-face interactions.Data from an online survey of lecturers (n = 105, March 2020) who teach social science methods and methodology at Austrian public universities was used to discuss their adaption behavior and the corresponding determinates. Consequently. a measure for the rate of adaption of teaching materials and methods per lecturer was constructed and a linear regression model employed to discuss the determinants of this adaption.The results show the following: Understanding online teaching as a permanent solution for the future. the extent of an individual's teaching load and a tenured employment were identified as significant influences fostering the adaption of teaching methods and materials to the online context. The predictors discovered differ from previous studies. and it has to be assumed that the adaption behavior in the wake of the pandemic had a profound impact on the ongoing digitalization of university education.

314,It is time to undertake changes in the evaluation methods we use. especially in higher education. These changes in the actors responsible for evaluation would combine hegemonic traditional evaluating processes with other. more democratic modalities. which would turn the predominantly institutional rating purposes of evaluation into a learning experience. and develop a competence in evaluation in students. Only in this way can coherence be achieved within the context of the student's initiative and the construction of their learning. mainly because of their real empowerment in the didactic process. either individually or in groups. A virtual platform has been developed to avoid increasing the teaching load and it is exposed in this work. The platform has been built and validated by potential users following the design-based research model. Its description. as well as its results. are explained.

To accomplish the objectives. using stratified random sampling. a total of 440 male and female teachers from state schools and private language schools in Tehran. Markazi. and Lorestan Provinces were selected. The quantitative data were gathered by means of a modified version of Horowitz and Zak's (1979) School Organizational Climate Questionnaire and Spector's (1985) Job Satisfaction Questionnaire. The qualitative data were also collected by administering interviews with 40 EFL teachers selected using stratified random sampling. Then. the data were analyzed through Pearson correlation. multiple regression analysis. and content analysis. Results revealed that there exists a significant positive correlation between the school organizational climate and the EFL teachers' job satisfaction. In addition. it was found that the job satisfaction is mostly affected by teaching load. principal leadership. autonomy and decision making. and intimacy and warmth factors. Besides. the findings disclosed that the school organizational climate is neither favorable nor positive such that it has negatively affected the Iranian EFL teachers' job satisfaction.

316,"Learning to teach science out-of-field (OOF)-teaching science without the required qualifications or specializations-raises a number of challenges for teachers. This paper uses a spatial-temporal lens to examine teachers' experiences of learning to teaching science subjects OOF over time. The analysis draws on longitudinal interviews with OOF teachers to examine two research questions: (1) How do teachers' allocation to teach science-related subjects OOF change over time?, and (2) What do teachers need to learn when teaching science OOF? Over time. it became clear that there were a number of career trajectories. which were indicative of teachers' future commitment to learn to teach science. Also. various dimensions of the change processes were identified that go beyond simply learning the content and how to teach it. Five categories of learning were identified: content. teaching strategies. students and their learning. the school landscape. and the professional self. The prominence of these categories shifted overtime. Also. teachers articulated which of these learnings arose because of having to teach out-of-field. for example. making links between in-field and OOF teaching was important as these links acted like boundary objects. Implications of this study suggest that teaching science OOF should be examined spatially in the context of a teacher's full teaching load at any one time. as well as in the context of temporal career and learning trajectories. Also. research into teachers' experiences of learning to teach OOF should consider the teacher in context. and in relation to teacher learning generally. PU  - ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS.

325,"OBJECTIVE: The aim: To find out the impact of exercise on promotion of health and restoration of mental capacity of instructors of higher educational institutions with specific learning environment.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: The research was conducted in 2018-2021. Research methods: theoretical analysis of literature sources. documentary method. pedagogical observation. The theoretical analysis of literature sources and documentary method allowed to clarify the role. place and objectives of physical training in the professional activities of the instructors, the pedagogical observation was used in the analysis of the instructors' professional activities.CONCLUSION: Conclusions: It was found that the instructors' professional activities are influenced by many negative factors: low motor activity. length of working day and week. forced working position. stress. mental overload. stress. lack of time for physical training. These factors result in the appearance of excess weight. dysfunction of major body systems. reduced mental capacity. the emergence of various diseases and labour costs. All this has a negative impact on the learning process of cadets. The direction for improving the physical training of instructors is to increase the amount of general physical training. conducting training sessions with different orientations taking into account age. physical condition. teaching load of instructors. as well as class time. A high level of instructors' general physical fitness will allow to effectively perform training tasks, strengthen their health, maintain a high level of mental capacity for a long time, extend professional longevity."
326,University course timetabling problem (UCTP) includes the challenging task of generating an automated timetable for courses under resource limitations. Manual generated timetables might hold some errors and consume a long time to create feasible solutions. Thus. there is a need to find optimal and fast solutions for this problem. The difficulty of the timetabling problem is further increased when tackling faculty-related constraints. according to their requirements. preferences. and availability. Thus. student-related constraints are usually the focus of UCTP generated solutions. in which faculty constraints are limited to their teaching load or preferences. This paper proposes a multi-objective mixed-integer programming model for a preregistration UCTP. combined with faculty-related constraints. The goal is to maximize events assignments and faculty-members preferences satisfaction while balancing the university requirements. At the same time. student learning days and unassigned events are minimized. The model is tested with eight real-world instances. Computational experiments are carried out to show the efficiency of the model. The proposed method can generate optimal timetables for all problem instances that satisfy faculty constraints.

327,Objective There have been only a limited number of studies available on the physical requirements in dance teachers (DT). who are responsible for the training of recreational and/or professional dancers and/or dance students. First results provide indications that a consideration of physical work load (teaching load) of this occupational group is necessary. Methods HR measurements were done on a total of 21 DT (f: n = 18. m: n = 3) aged 48.2 +/- 9.3 years during their lessons in three dance styles: ballet (B). jazz/modern dance (J/MD) and pre-school dance (CD). The HR data were objectified using the spiroergometrically measured maximum HR (HRmax). In addition. the rating of perceived exertion (RPE) was asked directly after the lesson using the Borg scale together with an additional questionnaire. Results Depending on the dance style. the average HR load during the lessons ranged between 56.7{\%} +/- 7.4{\%}) (B) and 63.6{\%} +/- 9.8{\%} (CD) of the individual HRmax. No significant differences could be found between the dance styles for the minimum. medium and maximum teaching loads. The DTs rated the average RPE of the teaching units according to BORG (11.4 +/- 2.1). Correlations between the RPE and the mean and maximum cardiovascular loads (r = 0.376. p = 0.037 and r = 0.441. p = 0.013) could be shown for all dance units and for the mean loads in J/MD (r = 0.558. p = 0.044). Conclusion Most dance units do not represent a load in the sense of a endurance training unit. An increase in aerobic fitness and possible positive effects in the context of injury prevention is not to be expected. In J/MD. the use of RPEs for the rough estimation of cardiovascular stress is conceivable. The assessment of cardiovascular load in dance lessons requires further investigations for more precise assessments. PU  - BMC PI  - LONDON PA  - CAMPUS. 4 CRINAN ST. LONDON N1 9XW. ENGLAND
328,"Learning-focussed educational models require the development of pedagogical. methodological. assessment and technological competences among the faculty community. The COVID-19 pandemic has accentuated the need for this training. This study evaluates the impact of the training project ""Educate to Transform"" on teacher attitudes. knowledge and on the implementation of innovative teaching methodologies. There were 695 faculty participants in the program conducted at the Universidad Francisco de Vitoria (UFV). Participants included full-time professors (FULL-PROF) and part-time professors (PART-PROF). The measurement instrument was validated using the entire sample and a subsample of 357 participants was used to analyse the impact of the program (pre and post measurement). Professor attitudes and knowledge of or familiarity with innovative methodologies and their application in the classroom were evaluated. The findings show that the program improved the attitudes of teachers towards innovation. raised the level of awareness and number of methodologies implemented in the classroom. The methodology towards more experiential and collaborative learning is effective in transforming teaching practice. Furthermore. the implementation of the program through the CANVAS platform. making teachers live the experience as learners. seems to have contributed to improve the teachers' attitude towards the LMS. The only difference found among the participants was a worse attitude towards innovation on the part of medical teachers. with a clearly differentiated profile of teachers and students. as well as a greater implementation of active methodologies by teachers with a lower teaching load. Overall. it may be concluded that the program achieved its proposed objectives. PU  - SPRINGER PI  - NEW YORK PA  - ONE NEW YORK PLAZA. SUITE 4600. NEW YORK. NY. UNITED STATES"
329,In medical studies. pharmacology is a subject with a high teaching and study load. The COVID-19 pandemic-related switch to distance learning implies challenges for students and teachers. To identify changes of behavior. attitudes. and needs among students and teachers in clinical pharmacology during the pandemic. regular surveys were conducted at Ulm University. Germany. Overall. 884 students and 5 teachers answered the survey. Over time. students' usage of learning materials in print form and further literature (textbooks. guidelines) constantly decreased. In turn. most students used digital materials provided via a learning management system. Attitudes and opinions of students and teachers significantly differed regarding (i) the benefit of certain teaching formats and learning materials. (ii) open-mindedness towards e-learning. and (iii) future visions. Most students and lecturers stated that they spent more time on study or teaching-related activities. respectively. and had less contact with fellow students or colleagues in comparison to pre-pandemic times. Furthermore. the subjective teaching load for most lecturers (80{\%}) increased during the pandemic. To identify determinants of learning success. the survey data were correlated with students' gradings in the written exams of clinical pharmacology. In the first online semester (summer term 2020). the use of paper-based learning scripts was correlated with better exam grades. No correlation with grade was found for any other learning materials. Age was inversely correlated with exam grading. Striking a balance between the future visions and needs of students and teachers implies a particular challenge for the educational system of the next years.

330,"With the continuous improvement of the network hardware environment. people turn the demand target to the network application environment and the construction of information resources. How to build a network teaching platform for general undergraduate teaching to ensure the stability of the system and high-quality services during operation especially large-scale concurrent access will inevitably lead to the increase in the business volume of each core part of the network. the number of visits. and data traffic. With the growth of the network. the corresponding processing power and computing intensity also increase rapidly. which causes problems such as overloading of core network equipment. network bottlenecks. and network congestion. Simply pursuing high-performance hardware to solve problems will undoubtedly result in high cost investment, moreover. equipment with excellent performance cannot meet the needs of the current rapidly growing business volume. According to the design goal of the dance online teaching platform. to meet the online teaching load requirements of many people at the same time. the pressure of the web server cluster must be great. Because many people in online at the same time put too much pressure on the web server. this part of the network cannot be processed in time. which leads to the phenomenon that the performance of this part and even the whole network is degraded. In severe cases. it will even cause network communication services to come to a standstill. that is. the so-called deadlock phenomenon. If the protocol software cannot detect congestion and reduce the packet sending rate. the network will be paralyzed due to congestion. This situation will cause the problem of movement delay for online dance teaching. which will seriously affect the quality of teaching. Therefore. the dance online course system should be continuously improved. the quality of online courses should be continuously improved. and the study of the practical application of load balancing technology in the network teaching environment has become an important means to solve the relationship between supply and demand of network teaching. According to the experimental analysis. when the number of Worker' actuators is fixed. the execution time span of MakeSpan increases with the increase of tasks. while the time required by the optimized load balancing algorithm proposed in this paper increases by 1.32 s on average with the increase of tasks. and the time required by heuristic algorithm and bee colony algorithm increases by 3.68 s and 3.45 s on average with the increase of tasks. On the whole. the optimized load balancing algorithm proposed in this paper has obvious advantages. PU  - HINDAWI LTD PI  - LONDON PA  - ADAM HOUSE. 3RD FLR. 1 FITZROY SQ. LONDON. W1T 5HF. ENGLAND"
331,"BackgroundFollowing the COVID-19 pandemic. distance education (DE) replaced traditional ""face-to-face"" teaching and has become the main method of teaching. The aim of this study was to 1) evaluate the impact of DE by teachers in our department during the second semester of the 2019-20 academic year following the March-May 2020 Italian national lockdown and 2) evaluate the relationship between DE and the emotional well-being of teachers during the period of home confinement.MethodsNinety-seven university teachers (51.5{\%} women, most represented age group 60-69years range. 40.2{\%}) responded to an anonymous online cross-sectional survey between July 15 - September 30. 2020. on the advantages and disadvantages of DE. developed by one online teacher focus group. The emotional conditions were assessed by a short version of the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). The internal consistency reliability survey and the 10-item BDI-II were measured by Cronbach's alpha. A correlation analysis (r-Pearson) was conducted between the overall evaluation of the experience of DE and the variables included in the study.ResultsTeachers reported difficulties in technical aspects. and in psychological factors. as the discomfort of ""speaking in the void"" (64.7{\%}). The absence of ""face-to-face"" eye contact with the students was complained by 81{\%} of teachers.Significant impairments in sleep patterns and loss of energy were reported. with female teachers having greater difficulty concentrating than their male colleagues.

333,In recent years. China's economic strength has been developing rapidly. At the same time. people's daily living standards have also been increasingly rising. In this context. the authorities are paying more and more attention to the training of students as well as talents. As a result. the quality of classroom teaching in universities has become a major concern. As an essential evaluation tool for teaching quality. evaluation of classroom teaching has been widely recognised and implemented. With the rapid development of computer technology and information technology. teaching evaluation based on various algorithms has been widely used. thus becoming an increasingly important teaching evaluation method. Thus. classroom teaching assessment has become one of the hot issues discussed in the field of education both at home and abroad. A great number of universities are now fully aware that the effectiveness of teachers is central to their survival and development and can have a direct impact on the training of students. The criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of teaching are highly subjective. but at the same time. there is a considerable degree of objectivity. As a result. the application of more scientific methods and computational data can make the results of classroom assessment more reliable. However. there is a lack of reliable reference data for evaluating the quality of classroom teaching in higher education. In addition. it is difficult to develop an evaluation data management and evaluation management model based on multiple data sources. which may cause a negative effect on the impartiality and objectivity of evaluation results. What is worse. many teachers do not have enough time to interact with their students. After all. most teachers in universities now have a heavy teaching load. and much of their time is spent on lesson preparation. Hence. they usually lack active interaction with their students. In the current education system. the objectives of higher education are mainly test-taking. and practical application is lacking. Therefore. based on the existing teaching basis. how to improve the effectiveness of university classroom teaching and improve the overall quality of students on the basis of test-taking objectives will be a key issue in teaching research. In order to solve this problem. this paper mainly researches the evaluation of classroom teaching quality in universities based on the interval intuitionistic fuzzy theory. This study is based on a detailed analysis of the needs of teaching quality assessment management. in terms of comprehensiveness of assessment and data sources. Then. the teaching evaluation system is designed and developed based on an analysis of the roles of students and teachers. This system can be applied to speed up the efficiency and fairness of teaching evaluation in universities. thereby greatly improving the management of teaching in universities.

335,The recent modernization of the higher education system in Russia developed a network of universities with special status and financial support. Such universities have become centers of attraction for young people from different regions of the Russian Federation. The focus of this study. however. is on how the universities that do not enjoy such a special status maintain and attract enrollment in such a context. More specifically. the study focuses on the social practices that underpin the process of such enrollment and utilizes the methodological framework for the study of social practices developed by Zaslayskaya.The study reveals that these universities face problems both with the quality and quantity of applicants. They spontaneously adapt to this situation by recruiting applicants to publicly and privately funded places in order to solve their internal contradictory problems - on one hand. to maintain enrollment in order to preserve an educational program and the teaching load of instructors. while. on the other. complying with regulatory requirements regarding the selection of applicants and the level of their further training. The violation of these requirements can have extremely negative consequences for universities.By analyzing normative documents. the study further reveals how these practices were formed to ensure the survival of universities. The author argues that existing practices distort competitive selection and create institutional obstacles to the modernization of regional economics by having a detrimental effect on regional human capital. These practices are. in part. of non-legal nature. because they are often accompanied by violations of regulatory requirements and moral obligations of universities to provide quality higher education. The article concludes. however. that the identified practices are not local. They are rooted differentially across Russian universities depending on their status. the competitive potential of universities and where universities operate. Finally. the author elaborates on solutions to transform existing practices in accordance with the goals of regional higher education systems.

336,The article studies special aspects of management of higher education institutions through the use of correlation analysis. There were twelve universities of Moscow and Moscow region that were included into selection. According to results of the conducted research the authors of article have come to the following conclusions. Universities' administrations are prone to compensate the defects of management. decrease of students' number and. as consequence. revenue contractions by laying off the teaching personnel. In this vein. teachers are the most voidable group in a system of higher education management. Meantime. the number of students does not influence the real financial revenue of higher education teaching personnel. which may increase only with the growth of teaching load. The same situation is with publication activity of academic staff. It seems. that universities' administration either does not use large-scale financial incentives to increase the publication activity of academic teaching personnel in journals from the information-analytical systems of scientific citation Web of Science and Scopus. or these incentives are not comparable with the labor and other costs of publishing scientific articles in these bases. which does not lead to the expected actions on the part of the faculty.In both cases. it is not fair to put the whole responsibility on managerial incompetence of higher institutions. The reasons. which lead to this situation. might be weak managemental independence. relatively lean funds allocated for research. which are most likely concentrated in leading universities.

337,The purpose of this study is to identify the barriers of university and industry cooperation and to develop recommendations for the internal ecosystem of technology commercialization. The research method used is a survey of three categories of experts from 9 universities of Almaty (researchers. technology transfer managers. spin-off-owners). Despite the strong efforts of the government of Kazakhstan in building innovation infrastructure. there is a low level of innovation activity. less than 5{\%} of university inventions are transferred into the industry. The results of the expert survey showed that the main barriers for cooperation between university and industry are: lack of resources to build university-industry links. lack of time due to high teaching load. poor qualification of technology transfer managers and lack of networking with industry. Based on the results of the expert survey. it is proposed to develop the ecosystem for the commercialization of university-based technologies. for which the following economic activities are important: human resources. financing. intellectual property management system. and intermediary infrastructure.

338,Achieving the Saudi Kingdom's vision 2030 in the higher education sector requires higher education institutions to make a significant simultaneous change in their current practices. This encompasses the transitioning of government-funded educational institutions to be financially independent. Therefore. a prompt. agile transition is required while maintaining a positive socioeconomic impact. entrepreneurship and innovation. and high-quality education. This necessitates the transition to lean processes and the review of current practices. One of the most vital processes in educational institutions is student admission/enrollment capacity planning. This study puts forward a capacity planning decision support system (DSS)-based framework for university student enrollment. The framework was applied to the case of KAU. where current practice and challenges are presented. and from which data were collected. A top-down/bottom-up approach was followed and applied using the goal programming technique and a developed mathematical model. respectively. Results show that the proposed framework effectively affects student admission/enrollment capacity planning on strategic and operational levels. Moreover. it can be used in other planning aspects of higher education in universities. such as human resources planning. teaching load planning. faculty-to-student ratios. accreditation. quality requirements. lab capacity planning. equipment/teaching aids procurement. and financial planning. to mention a few. The implications of this study include assisting decision-makers in higher education institutions in matching their admission/enrollment capacity of student numbers between the macro-strategic and the micro-operational level.

340,In this study we investigate college instructors' use of practices that facilitate interactions in online college courses. We begin by drawing on several strands of literature to offer a person purpose interaction framework with two dimensions - one regarding the entities involved in the interaction (instructor. student. content) and the other regarding the pedagogical goal of the interaction (academic. social. managerial) - that result in six sub-domains of practices. Subsequently. we examine the frequency of. and factors associated with instructors' use of these six domains. using survey data collected from online college instructors (N = 126) from a large community college. The results show that instructors using more interaction-oriented practices consistently have greater employment stability and teaching load. greater self-efficacy for using learning management systems. and greater perceived benefits of online learning for students. The findings have several implications for future research examining pedagogical behavior. as well as the design of professional development activities aimed at enhancing the use of effective online instructional practices among college instructors.

Using data from six cohorts of students at a UC campus. we examine the impact of initial course-taking with three distinct types of instructors-tenure-track research faculty. tenure-track teaching faculty. and contingent lecturers-on students' current and subsequent academic outcomes. Descriptive analyses indicate that tenure-track teaching faculty assume a substantially larger teaching load than either research faculty or lecturers. Using a three-way fixed effects model. we find limited evidence supporting differences by faculty type on either current or downstream student outcomes.

342,Video conferencing has enabled synchronous communication in a classroom and created multi-sensory content to stimulate learners. Artificial intelligence involves complex equations that are better taught using a constructive pedagogy where students experiment with alternative ways of solving the same problem. Multiple-choice questions have high reliability and can easily reveal student skill levels in a quick way. The Australian Computer Society accreditation exercise ensures that the content for each subject serves as a flexible template for teaching. The geographical extent of the country requires the presence of multiple subordinate campuses affiliated to a main campus. Following the concept of strands. it was also necessary to show continuity in learning and assessments between the first- and second-year subjects. Student feedback for subjects with artificial intelligence-based simulations showed that several students found it difficult to understand lectures and assignments. Hence. to measure student learning. we introduced a Kahoot quiz during the recess of each lecture that students could join through their mobile phones from different campuses. Software project management is challenging for students with vision or attention-related disorders. We taught them how to use charts to visually observe variables and narrow down possible relationships before performing in-depth analysis. One of the main purposes of education is employability.

The use of a version of the SIMCAM simulator adapted to the educational context enabled our DSP students to exercise important facets of DSP that are otherwise difficult or impossible to incorporate in student activities. Analyzing and quantifying the assumed benefits of this educational intervention on student learning enables us to better adapt such interventions to student needs. To investigate the impact on student learning of this novel use of a simulator we analyze both the course-assessment results and the constructors of the technology acceptance model. the latter via an initial survey of student perceptions carried out at the beginning of the course and another carried out after completing the simulator-based assignment.

345,A project-based course involving the design. analysis. manufacturing. testing. and launching of mid-power solid-propellant rockets over a ten-week period has been developed and taught as an approach to enhance the education and preparation of aerospace engineers at the university level. The course consists of a sequence of structured laboratory assignments that expose students to common software tools. aerospace materials. manufacturing techniques. and testing methods that directly inform and run parallel to the project. Teams of four to five students complete the project (and portions of the labs) collaboratively within an engineering competition framework. Individual students within each team are assigned specific engineering roles (e.g. design engineer. manufacturing engineer) to create an interdependence that reflects a typical integrated product team in industry and exposes students to realistic social dynamics. Student teams conduct design reviews as progressive milestones for assessment. in addition to laboratory assignments.

347,It is time to undertake changes in the evaluation methods we use. especially in higher education. These changes in the actors responsible for evaluation would combine hegemonic traditional evaluating processes with other. more democratic modalities. which would turn the predominantly institutional rating purposes of evaluation into a learning experience. and develop a competence in evaluation in students. Only in this way can coherence be achieved within the context of the student's initiative and the construction of their learning. mainly because of their real empowerment in the didactic process. either individually or in groups. A virtual platform has been developed to avoid increasing the teaching load and it is exposed in this work. The platform has been built and validated by potential users following the design-based research model. Its description. as well as its results. are explained. Regarding the description. two interfaces are mentioned-one for teachers and another for students. Concerning its validation. the results of this quantitative and qualitative study confirm its functionality as a valid tool for evaluation. It is predicted that the utilization and impact of this tool will not only be beneficial for the evaluation dimension. but also for the overall improvement of the teaching experience.

349,Research on factors that have an influence on scholars' success has a rather long tradition. but only recently has this research field become a hot topic in management research. which means that our knowledge of the determinants of success in business academia is fairly new and fragmented. The study presented in this paper contributes to this knowledge by empirically testing the influence of selected factors on research productivity of young business scholars working in Visegrad countries (the Czech Republic. Hungary. Poland. and Slovakia). The research productivity is defined and measured through scholars' publication scores. including publications in journals with JCR's Impact Factor (IF). The study suggests that among key determinants of the success of a business scholar from Visegrad area. there are English language skills and teaching load. Surprisingly. productivity of young business scholars seems not to be leveraged much by the recognizability of their supervisors. Moreover. contrary to some other studies. teaching load correlates positively with research productivity. At the end of the paper. the results of empirical study are discussed in the context of prior studies and specific features of academia in postcommunist countries.

350,"With the dramatic emergence of the Covid -19 Virus. teachers in schools and universities have been challenged to move from face-to-face to distance learning. This required an update on the materials and the workflow to adapt the teaching approach to the online context and ensure the learning quality. In this work. we will present the adopted approach in a particular course which is procedural programming. a course given for the first-year engineering students of our engineering school. We use two pedagogical approaches for teaching this course: the flipped classroom and the problem-based learning (PBL). The challenge was how to assure team working and provide the same coaching quality, facilitating. problem solving. group management and so on using the same teaching load. Major changes have been made to the current approach. including scripting sessions and teams' coaching. A pedagogical scenario has been developed to enable coaching via video conferences while keeping the active aspect. Students work on their problem situation through collaborative tools and in the virtual presence of their coach. An e-learning platform has been adopted to allow asynchronous interactions. Our reform also affected the length of sessions. assessment and the types of teaching materials used to substitute physical presence in a classroom and the use of a blackboard.

351,The Degree of Gastronomy and Culinary Arts of the University of Alicante has as main objective the integral formation of professionals with the necessary knowledge to understand and exercise in any activity and professional situation related to the gastronomic sciences. More specifically. the first course of this degree is defined by a teaching load of 42 credits of basic training and 18 credits corresponding to compulsory subjects. Based on the objectives and competences of the first course. the student must acquire. in addition to specific skills. basic and general skills such as reading and understanding texts in a foreign language demonstrate skills and abilities in computer science and demonstrate skills in oral and written communication. It is necessary to add to these competences the acquisition of the essential knowledge to perform basic laboratory operations as well as the ability to perform simple mathematical calculations and basic statistical notions. This work focuses on the challenge of developing transversal activities to improve general and basic student's skills [1].In the 2018/2019 academic year. an average of 60 students (depending on the subject) were enrolled in the first course of Gastronomy and Culinary Arts degree. to which they were given an initial questionnaire in order to know their prior knowledge and academic trajectory. Based on the obtained results. some deficiencies were detected such as: insufficient computer skills. insufficient ability to read and understand a foreign language and poor ability to write academic works. In order to improve these deficiencies. the following educational actions have been carried out in the science subjects: a) Reading a scientific research article in English. b) Seminar of materials of laboratory and basic laboratory operations. c) Basic mathematical calculations. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of these approaches. some instruments were developed collecting qualitative data through continuous students and professor feedback. As a result of the present project. new teaching tools are available that have made possible to improve the basic skills of the students.

The article is devoted to the analysis of legislation on personal data and it's enforcement in the educational process in higher educational institutions.The purpose of the article is highlight controversies in legislation on personal data. generating mistakes in enforcement during the educational procedures.The description of methodology. The author uses methods of complex analysis. synthesis. as well as formal-logical and formal-legal methods.The main results and scope of their application. The practice of interpreting the concepts of ""personal data"". ""confidential personal data"". ""official secret"". ""publicly available personal data"" is extremely contradictory.Currently. there are hundreds departmental regulatory legal acts about various aspects of the protection of official secrets. Analysis of these acts shows that the rules aimed at preserving the confidentiality of official information regulate the following aspects of the functioning of state and municipal bodies. institutions and organizations: (a) ensuring access to official information, (b) providing state and municipal services, (c) document flow and record keeping, (d) staffing, (e) anti-corruption, (f) use of information systems, (g) interaction with the media, (h) prevention of conflicts of interest.The study load cannot be attributed to the personal data. that requires the consent of the teacher to be processed. The study load is nothing more than publicly available information. arising from the principles of collegiality of educational process management. competitiveness of education. its openness and transparency. that are established in the legislation on education.Conclusions. Extended interpretation of confidential personal data and inclusion of the teaching load to it is unacceptable. This contributes to conflicts of interest. corrupt factors and devaluation of higher education. PU  - DOSTOEVSKY OMSK STATE UNIV PI  - OMSK PA  - PROSPEKT MIRA 55-A. OMSK. 644077. RUSSIA"

356,"We consider a principal who periodically offers a fixed and costly nonmonetary reward to agents to incentivize them to invest effort over the long run. An agent's output. as a function of his effort. is a priori uncertain and is worth a fixed per-unit value to the principal. The principal's goal is to design an attractive reward policy that specifies how the rewards are to be given to an agent over time based on that agent's past performance. This problem. which we denote by P. is motivated by practical examples from both academia (e.g.. a reduced teaching load) and industry (e.g.. ""Supplier of the Year"" awards). The following ""limited-term"" (LT) reward policy structure has been quite popular in practice. The principal evaluates each agent periodically, if an agent's performance over a certain (limited) number of periods in the immediate past exceeds a predefined threshold. then the principal rewards him for a certain (limited) number of periods in the immediate future. When agents' outputs are deterministic in their efforts. we show that there always exists an optimal policy that is an LT policy and also. obtain such a policy. When agents' outputs are stochastic. we show that the class of LT policies may not contain any optimal policy of problem P but is guaranteed to contain policies that are arbitrarily near optimal. Given any epsilon {\textgreater} 0. we show how to obtain an LT policy whose performance is within e of that of an optimal policy. This guarantee depends crucially on the use of sufficiently long histories of the agents' outputs. We also analyze LT policies with short histories and derive structural insights on the role played by (i) the length of the available history and (ii) the variability in the random variable governing an agent's output. We show that the average performance of these policies is within 5{\%} of the optimum. justifying their popularity in practice. We then introduce and analyze the class of ""score-based"" reward policies, we show that this class is guaranteed to contain an optimal policy and also. obtain such a policy. Finally. we analyze a generalization in which the principal has a limited number for rewards in any given period and show that the class of score-based policies. with modifications to accommodate the limited availability of the rewards. continues to contain an optimal solution for the principal.

There is a need to promote nursing research in Asia to enhance the contextual relevance of their evidence-based nursing interventions. A first step toward this goal is to determine the perceived research capacity among nursing faculty in academic settings in the Philippines.METHODS. This study described the perceived research capacity among nursing faculty of the University of Santo Tomas-College of Nursing. Manila. Philippines. The study used a survey that contained four sections: subject demographics, knowledge and skill on research designs and research process, research involvement. services. and incentives, and factors affecting research involvement. Chi-square test of homogeneity and MANOVA analyzed the gathered data.RESULTS. Findings showed that the faculty perceived themselves as knowledgeable and skillful in conducting research. However. current teaching assignments hindered their capacity to conduct research. University-sponsored incentives and college-based research services had also remained underutilized despite their availability. Overall. heavy teaching load was the greatest hindrance to research endeavors.CONCLUSION.

359,Background. All UK medical schools are revising their curricula following the General Medical Council recommendations to increase general practice involvement in undergraduate education. However. workload in general practice has increased in recent years. raising questions about its ability to maintain. let alone extend. its educational activities.Aim. The aim of this study was examine whether recent changes in general practice have affected delivery of practice-based undergraduate education and to assess the extent to which practices will be able to increase their involvement in teaching.Method. A postal questionnaire survey was conducted of the lead clinical teachers and their partners in the practices to which students from Leicester Medical School had been attached in the last 2 years.Results. The questionnaire was completed by 32 out of the 39 lead teachers and 134 of the 150 partners. an overall response rate of 88{\%}. There was widespread support for departmental teaching requirements. but only 17 lead teachers (44{\%}) felt that the suggested reduction by 25{\%} of patients seen per session while teaching was feasible. A total of 14 lead teachers (47{\%}) felt that the ability of their practice to deliver high-quality teaching had declined since 1990. Altogether. 113 (87{\%}) of all doctors in teaching practices felt that rime pressures had increased during this period. and 139 (88{\%}) felt that present levels of remuneration were inadequate. The majority of these doctors felt that general practice was the preferred location for learning generic clinical skills and were interested in participating. Nevertheless. most were not prepared to increase their involvement in teaching under present arrangements.Conclusion. Practice-based teachers appreciate the need for quality teaching. remain enthusiastic about teaching and are. in principle. willing to take an increased teaching load. However. recent changes have made delivery of teaching more difficult. and if an expansion in practice-based teaching is to occur. more realistic levels of funding and support are a prerequisite.

360,To comply with the European Higher Education Area (EHEA) in Spain. a law was published (RD 1393/2007) which regulates official studies for degrees. masters and doctorates. Several new Pharmacy degrees have been approved by the Ministry for Education according to this law. both in public and private universities. The objective of our work was to analyse these Pharmacy degrees. paying attention to the content of the various modules. as well as to the relative percentage of teaching load within each topic in the curricula according to its nature: basic. obligatory and optional. We can conclude that the degrees of all universities analysed are very homogeneous. particularly in regard to the formative content of the established modules. in accordance to the general guidelines. The greater variation seems to be located in optional subjects as well as in Art and Humanities modules. the latter being quite common in private universities. PU  - UNIV GRANADA.

In the late 1970s. the university administration implemented a permanent evaluation system of the activities assigned to the teaching staff. through which it was intended. in addition to systematizing objective and precise information regarding the work of the academic units. the institutional dynamics and the service provided by the University, determine the financial needs related to the hiring of academic staff and. within the framework of the social contract that the University maintains with Costa Rican society. make university management transparent. assist in the accountability process and strengthen the institutional internal control system. Despite the fact that the main objective of the evaluation of academic teaching loads has not experienced significant variations over time. in the course of its existence. it has registered important operational changes. mainly due to three elements: the diversification of the activities carried out by academic staff, the gradual incorporation of technology in the evaluation process, and the modification of the institutional normative framework that regulates the assignment and administration of the academic teaching load of the teaching staff. an aspect that. given its relevance. is reviewed in this article. which. concomitantly. attempts to elucidate some fundamental conceptual elements to understand this evaluation and point out the existing link between this evaluative exercise and the construct of educational quality.

364,Mapping the competency of personnel with different level of expertise. skill set. and experience in professional fields is a tough. complex but essential task. In this work. we have considered an Engineering College with moderate number of faculties with different level of experience. expertise and research exposure. Here we have considered the load assignment to the faculties at the beginning of a semester as the competency mapping task. Each faculty having capabilities of teaching different subjects out of the total set of papers needs to take about two theory papers with or without laboratory component. The decisive factors for subject assignment may be depth of knowledge. sincerity. class management. contribution towards research. text book publication. Further preference of the faculty member should be considered with top priority unless there are some valid constraints. Again the teaching personnel in a department hold different designations and different administrative responsibility. therefore each of them cannot be assigned equal hours of teaching load. The decisive factors are considered as objectives to be optimized and multi-objective particle Swarm optimization (MOPSO) is employed to perform the competency mapping task. The simulation results show the effectiveness of this approach. PU  - IEEE PI  - NEW YORK PA  - 345 E 47TH ST. NEW YORK. NY 10017 USA
365,Background: The use of electronic learning formats (e-learning) in medical education is reported mainly from individual specialty perspectives. In this study. we analyzed the implementation level of e-learning formats and the institutional support structures and strategies at an institutional level in a cluster of mid-European medical schools.Methods: A 49-item online questionnaire was send to 48 medical schools in Austria. Germany and Switzerland using SurveyMonkey (R). Data were collected between February and September of 2013 and analyzed using quantities. statistical and qualitative means.Results: The response rate was 71 {\%}. All schools had implemented e-learning. but mainly as an optional supplement to the curriculum. E-learning involved a wide range of formats across all disciplines. Online learning platforms were used by 97 {\%} of the schools. Full-time e-learning staff was employed by 50 {\%}. and these had a positive and significant effect on the presence of e-learning in the corresponding medical schools. In addition. 81 {\%} offered training programs and qualifications for their teachers and 76 {\%} awarded performance-oriented benefits. with 17 {\%} giving these for e-learning tasks. Realization of e-learning offers was rewarded by 33 {\%}. with 27 {\%} recognizing this as part of the teaching load. 97 {\%} would use curriculum-compatible e-learning tools produced by other faculties.Conclusions: While all participating medical schools used e-learning concepts. this survey revealed also a reasonable support by institutional infrastructure and the importance of staff for the implementation level of e-learning offerings. However. data showed some potential for increasing tangible incentives to motivate teachers to engage in further use of e-learning. Furthermore. the use of individual tools and the distribution of e-learning presentations in various disciplines were quite inhomogeneous. The willingness of the medical schools to cooperate should be capitalized for the future. especially concerning the provision of e-learning tools and concepts.

366,"This article deals with the life and work of the Belgian legal historian R.C. van Caene em. It shows how van Caenegem's work was influenced by his teachers. first of all FrancoisLouis Ganshof. but also many others like Theodore Plucknett. Van Caenegem's research was very diverse and addressed different groups of readers. so that most of them only know a fragment of his work. Van Caenegem learned from Ganshof's mistakes. Unlike his master. van Caenegem took an interest in sociology and he did not hesitate to publish the grand overviews of history which Ganshof had stopped writing in the second half of his career. Many of van Caenegem'slmoks on English. medieval and legal history were a product of his teaching. Whereas the books for the students in Ghent. where van Caenegem was burdened by a heavy teaching load. presented a complete survey, the books for select groups of foreign students cherry-picked from legal history and took part in discussions on larger debates. Van Caenegem's many articles offer a better insight into his personal evolution from a scholar who started out as a jurist. but very soon lost interest in dogmatic legal history and preferred to investigate the lawmakers instead of the law itself. As a historian. van Caenegetn put the middle ages first. because in his opinion the middle ages laid the foundations for the modern rule of law. However. these 'modem' middle ages only started in the twelfth century. Although he claimed that the future of legal historical research lays in teamwork. van Caenegetn himself remained an indvidualistic scholar.

The survey instrument was adapted. with permission. from the instrument reported by Boyer and Cockriel (1998) for administration online. Several significant motivators were identified for the faculty: opportunity to probe or research new information, personnel support such as graduate assistants and clerical help when proposals are funded, having travel money available for conferences, building my professional reputation as a capable researcher, personnel support such as graduate assistants and clerical help when preparing proposals, more flexibility in how time is allocated, and assistance in grant proposal preparation. One important barrier to grant writing was identified: inadequate support available to submit proposals in a timely manner. One significant difference (heavy teaching load) was identified between tenured and non-tenured faculty.

368,"Teacher education research in Turkey can be categorized under five headings: attitudes and perceptions of teacher candidates toward teaching, competency perceptions of teacher candidates, school experience, assessment of teacher education programs, and the impact of teacher education research on teacher candidates' knowledge. skills and attitudes. Research on attitudes and perceptions of teaching is carried out mostly through surveys. whereas quantitative. qualitative and mixed designs are used in studying teacher education programs and school experience. The relations between teacher education process and the knowledge. skills and attitudes of teacher candidates are explored through experimental. correlational and qualitative designs. Most of these research studies focus on descriptive aspects of teacher education rather than exploring relations among teacher education and teacher performance in schools. There are several reasons for narrow scope of teacher education research: First. there is no agreement on the terms used in the field of teacher education. Second. teacher education programs are determined by the Higher Education Council. Third. the research is mostly geared toward the students and instructors at the faculties of education rather than teachers in schools. Fourth. the teaching load of the instructors at faculties of education is heavy. thereby not leaving much time for research.

371,Achieving the Saudi Kingdom's vision 2030 in the higher education sector requires higher education institutions to make a significant simultaneous change in their current practices. This encompasses the transitioning of government-funded educational institutions to be financially independent. Therefore. a prompt. agile transition is required while maintaining a positive socioeconomic impact. entrepreneurship and innovation. and high-quality education. This necessitates the transition to lean processes and the review of current practices. One of the most vital processes in educational institutions is student admission/enrollment capacity planning. This study puts forward a capacity planning decision support system (DSS)-based framework for university student enrollment. The framework was applied to the case of KAU. where current practice and challenges are presented. and from which data were collected. A top-down/bottom-up approach was followed and applied using the goal programming technique and a developed mathematical model. respectively. Results show that the proposed framework effectively affects student admission/enrollment capacity planning on strategic and operational levels. Moreover. it can be used in other planning aspects of higher education in universities. such as human resources planning. teaching load planning. faculty-to-student ratios. accreditation. quality requirements. lab capacity planning. equipment/teaching aids procurement. and financial planning. to mention a few. The implications of this study include assisting decision-makers in higher education institutions in matching their admission/enrollment capacity of student numbers between the macro-strategic and the micro-operational level.

372,Teaching a language subject in school is often referred to as being different and unique compared to teaching a non-language subject. However. the few existing studies examining this claim have mainly investigated the viewpoints of teachers who only teach one language. thus failing to achieve a comparison based on teachers' actual lived experiences of teaching two different subjects. The present study was designed to address this gap by exploring 11 upper secondary school teachers' perceptions of similarities and differences between teaching English and a non-language subject. Austria and Norway were chosen as contexts for the study since both countries qualify state secondary school teachers to teach a minimum of two subjects simultaneously as part of their regular teaching load. The analysis of the semi-structured interviews revealed that the teaching of various subjects shares some similarities but is highly influenced by contextual factors. The most striking finding was the perceived different status of subjects across contexts and the consequences of this for teachers and learners. The findings underline the importance of contextualizing data and understanding the ecology in which teaching and learning of any subject or any language takes place.

373,Educational leadership is essential to implement information and communications technologies in schools but the leadership practice of information and communications technologies coordinators. a position role that supports teachers to implement information and communications technologies. appears limited. The present study applies a distributed perspective to leadership and investigates aspects of information and communications technologies coordinator context that would facilitate leadership. Twenty-seven information and communications technologies coordinators were surveyed on their schools' structures and mechanisms that mediate their leadership practice. Descriptive statistics show that a wide range of structures and mechanisms in different quantities and with different qualities can be available to coordinators. The majority of coordinators have neither additional position roles nor a teaching load. but the coordinators have organizational unit assignments and attend daily. routine interactions. A case study illustrates how specific structures and mechanisms would facilitate leadership for information and communications technologies implementation. It is recommended to design an information and communications technologies coordinator role as a formal position role. for a school to employ more than one information and communications technologies coordinator. and to develop an information and communications technologies coordinator's teaching load. organizational unit assignments and routine interactions according to school needs. Several possible populations of information and communications technologies coordinators are identified for further research.

374,The teaching responsibilities of faculty members are worked out with their respective departments and/or colleges. Teaching loads are usually fixed. but individual faculty may have options on how to meet that load. They may choose more or fewer different courses. multiple sections of an individual course. a combination of undergraduate and graduate classes. or a combination of face-to-face and distance-education classes. On the assumption that new faculty can learn from the experience of others. a survey was administered to faculty from across the country. primarily in engineering programs. The results offer guidance on what combinations of courses to request to maximize one's effectiveness. PU  - AMER SOC ENGINEERING EDUCATION PI  - WASHINGTON PA  - 1818 N STREET. NW SUITE 600.

The merits of the method include reduced faculty teaching load. the potential to accommodate increased numbers of students without comparable increases in faculty or physical plant. apparent improvement in the quality of instruction. student satisfaction. early identification of marginal students. and conservation of cadavers.
376,"The initial objective attributed to the research assessment granting of university teaching staff (the so-called sexenio) was to recognize research effort of the university professors. However. this assessment has been linked to numerous aspects university life: determines the remuneration. teaching load. the possibility of promotion. the participation as teacher in masters and doctoral courses. the possibility of being examiner or even supervisor of doctoral dissertations. participation in the Advisory Committees of the National Commission for Evaluating the Research Activity (CNEAI). as well as being a part of the accreditation commissions and a long etcetera. Given the importance that this evaluation has gained and will acquire in a future. in the present work we will study the differences in the percentage of teachers with sexenio. Not only between scientific fields. but also between areas belonging to the same field. showing an interesting result in the differences by areas. Our condition of university accounting teachers. makes us to focus in the field 8. where the knowledge area of ""Accounting and finance"" is located.The debate that arises from the results of this work is: Why Accounting and Finance has Sciences has so few representatives within the advisory committees in comparison with the importance in terms of teaching staff. students. etc.? Moreover. to what extent this minimal representation implies worse results in the evaluation of teachers of the area? This situation conforms a vicious circle: if there are no accounting teachers awarded with sexenio. they would not be able to be part of the Expert Commissions that grant those assessments.

378,Objectives: of the present cross sectional study were to analyze the offer of subjects with communication skills in the nursing degree in Spain and to describe the distribution of these subjects. Documentary. systematic and independent search of web pages from Spanish universities was carried out to collect the following variables: subjects with communication skills. course in which the subject is taught. type of teaching (exclusive or combined). type of subject (compulsory or optional) and number of credits on communication skills. Although an average of 3.6 subjects per center was offered. most of the subjects were combined and with little communication content load. In one third of the centers. the offer was below 2.3 credits. Only 1 in 6 centers had exclusive communication skills subjects. and a quarter of them were optional. The teaching load of communication contents was highest in optional subjects. The offer of communication skills contents in Spanish Nursing Schools was scarce and very heterogeneous between centers and between courses in a center. with excessive presence of combined and optional subjects. Our results may be useful when developing the teaching guides for subjects with communication skills. as well as when defining communication competencies in the different Nursing Schools.

380,In spite of the growth of Israel's population. the number of graduates from the four Israeli Schools of Medicine has changed very little in the last 30 years. Nevertheless. the annual number of new practitioners grew from about 300 to 900. due to Israeli graduates of European Schools and the large number of physicians among the new immigrants from the former USSR states in the early nineties. A committee. nominated by the National Board of Higher Education (MALAG). headed by the late Prof. Pazi. concluded that under steady state conditions we must train 800 medical students per year. MALAG adopted this recommendation. As a first step. MALAG approved two new programs: a special program for Academic Reserve candidates (Atudaim) and a new (5th) medical school in the Galilee. These two new programs. together with the new 4-year MD program in Tel Aviv. will add about 200 graduates to the list of medical students. Yet. the question of whether we can realize the recommendation of Pazi's Committee (to train 800 MDs annually) and at what cost. remains open. This preliminary review is devoted to the relevant factors that must be considered before the latter questions can be answered. First. we note that the limiting factor of the number of medical students is the ratio between the number of teaching departments in each of the medical disciplines and the number of weeks of Clerkships required in the given disciplines. Our main conclusion is that realization of the recommendation of Pazi's committee requires an increase in the number of teaching departments. preferably by upgrading the academic level of those departments that do not teach students. and increasing the teaching load of other departments. We may also have to reduce the number of weeks of 'bedside teaching' but should beware of reducing it to a minimum lower than about 70 weeks. as in North America. Regardless of the need to train more physicians. we must increase teaching in the community. Only a combination of all these measures will reduce our dependence on the education of Israeli physicians abroad.
381,The concept of Task World Reality (TWR) for a sensor-based robot system and human operator at the worksite is proposed. Based on the TWR concept. a Multimodal Teaching Advisor (MTA) which utilizes the work-site human operator's know-how and sensory information in a complementary manner has been developed. This system integrates task specifications. system constraints including their tolerances. sensing information. and operator- and robot-related information. MTA provides both graphical and audio user interfaces using a spatial human tracker in Order to support an advanced teaching environment for a work-site operator. A complicated spatial path tracking task is taken as a typical case study. Experimental results show that not only the human operator's teaching load but also the task quality are greatly improved by MTA. PU  - IEEE PI  - NEW YORK PA  - 345 E 47TH ST. NEW YORK.

382,"The increasingly digitized healthcare system requires new skills from all those involved. In order to impart these competencies. appropriate courses must be developed at educational institutions. In view of the rapid development of new aspects of digitization. this presents a challenge, suitable teaching formats must be developed successively. The establishment of cross-location teaching networks is one way to better meet training needs and to make the necessary spectrum of educational content available. As part of the Medical Informatics Initiative. the HiGHmed consortium is establishing such a teaching network. in the field of medical informatics. which covers many topics related to the digitization of the health care system.Various problem areas in the German education system were identified that hinder the development of the teaching network. These problem areas were prioritized firstly according to the urgency of the solution from the point of view of the HiGHmed consortium and secondly according to existing competencies in the participating societies. A workshop on the four most relevant topics was organized with experts from the German Society for Medical Informatics. Biometry and Epidemiology (GMDS). the Society for Medical Education (GMA) and the HiGHmed consortium. These are:1. recognition of exam results from teaching modules that are offered digitally and across locations. and their integration into existing curricula,2. recognition of digital. cross-location teaching in the teachers' teaching load,3. nationwide uniform competencies for teachers. in order to be able to conduct digital teaching effectively and with comparable quality,4. technical infrastructure to efficiently and securely communicate and manage the recognition of exam results between educational institutions.For all subject areas. existing preliminary work was identified on the basis of working questions. and short- and long-term needs for action were formulated. Finally. a need for the redesign of a technologically supported syntactic and semantic interoperability of learning performance recording was identified.

383,"Newly-emergent universities face a plethora of problems which bedevil development efforts and inhibit the building of a research culture almost from scratch. These challenges arise from lack of human and material resources. lack of research infrastructure. lack of role models and mentors and general capacity problems often lumped together and described as a general lack of a ""research culture."" In order to redress this lack of a research culture and encourage the building of an active research enterprise. the 10-year old University of Technology. Jamaica introduced a seed grant mechanism in 1998. since re-designated the Research Development Fund (RDF) to encourage staff of the university to pursue research activity. Despite this initiative. response to the funding has been lackluster. In this paper. we investigate the reasons why academic staff at the University have not utilized this promising facility and what could be done to encourage more active participation in research.Out of the 66 academic staff who responded to a questionnaire survey. 74.2{\%} claimed to be aware of the available funding for research in the university but only 10.6{\%} had applied for funding under the RDF mechanism between 1999 and 2004. Of those who applied. only half were successful. However. about a third of the respondents have been utilizing other funds for research outside of the RDF. The reasons given for not applying for the fund include lack of time to write the proposal or conduct the study (46.9{\%}). the bureaucracy surrounding the release of the fund (22.8{\%}). the paucity of information in the proposal form and the tedious application process (19.6{\%}) while 7.5{\%} of the respondents were deterred by fear of being rejected. However. such reasons may just underlie the need for more capacity building efforts. research training and mentorship at all levels. A number of suggestions were made by the respondents in order to encourage increased participation in the application process. These include a more customer-friendly application process. reduction in teaching load in favor of research. research mentorship and the reduction in staff participation at meetings and other administrative duties.

Self-determination theory (SDT) has shown promise as a conceptual frame for characterizing the relationship between environmental support factors and NTT faculty satisfaction. Full-time NTT faculty were sampled nationwide (N = 3.527) to investigate an SDT-based model positing basic psychological needs (i.e.. volitional autonomy and relatedness) as mediators between six environmental support indices and NTT faculty satisfaction (i.e.. teaching/service and global satisfaction). Structural equation model results showed volitional autonomy and relatedness fully mediated the relationships between the six environmental supports and both indices of faculty satisfaction.

Special attention is paid to the study of mental and somatic status of students with maximum stressful tension during the examination session. Consequently. the studied scientific sources demonstrate the peculiarities of mental work of students. which allow us to regard it as a special kind of activity. characterized by the presence of unfavorable social and psychological factors. the combined effect of which can lead to a decrease in the level of mental and somatic health and the development of subclinical and clinical mental disorders.
386,"The ""Degree in Chemistry"" program at the University of Alicante-UA- entails a great teaching load aimed at industrial work opportunities as well as research. development and innovation. However. it clearly lacks a didactic and pedagogical training. which obliges those students who desire a teaching professional future to develop the necessary pedagogical skills through a Master's Degree. Other universities. like the National University of Rosario-UNR-(Argentina). proposes two clearly different degrees on chemistry formation in order to meet the future professional prospects of both. those who prefer to be engaged in industry or innovation-research. and those who aim to become chemistry educators.In view of the UNR ""Chemistry Degree"" and ""Chemistry Teaching Degree"" academic plans. the authors propose an adaptation of the aforementioned programs to the ""Degree in Chemistry"" taught by the UA. The present work describes a new and unique studying plan which includes two alternative stands depending on the job orientation desired by the student: i) pedagogical strand, and ii) disciplinary strand. For a training oriented to industry. research and development. the current curriculum of the University of Alicante would be maintained. but would also include some pedagogical subjects. In this way. the student would be prepared to face a professional work position where the transmission of knowledge could also be necessary. On the contrary. the student could access a teaching-oriented training according to a curriculum that combines the subjects of disciplinary training (common to the path of industrial orientation) and an important teaching load of pedagogy. This multidisciplinary aspects studied in the degree. allows to perform a professor to teach for all the educational chemistry levels.

387,Studies have provided evidence that Interprofessional Education (IPE) can improve learners' attitudes. knowledge. skills. behaviors. and competency. Traditionally. IPE is commonly seen in the healthcare professional training in tertiary education. Aging is a global issue that requires more than just a single healthcare sector. It requires interdisciplinary collaboration and understanding to tackle the issues. Therefore. IPE is essential for nurturing university students to tackle the ever-changing global challenges. In addition. different hurdles can hinder IPE development. To have a better understanding of the feasibility. acceptance. and educational value of IPE in Hong Kong. we conducted a cross-sectional quantitative study. We invited teachers and students from a Hong Kong university to fill in an online survey that evaluated their understanding and participation in IPE. their attitude toward IPE. and the barriers to developing IPE from March to June 2020. Among the 37 academic staff and 572 students who completed the survey. 20 (54.1{\%}) teachers and 422 (73.8{\%}) students had never heard of IPE before. and 26 (70.3{\%}) teachers and 510 (89.2{\%}) students had never participated in any IPE activities. Major barriers reported by teachers included an increase in teaching load (72.9{\%}). lack of administrative support (72.9{\%}). lack of financial support and limited budget (67.5{\%}). difficulty to make logistic arrangements (64.8{\%}). and problems with academic schedules and calendars (62.1{\%}). The survey findings revealed that despite the positive attitude of university teachers and students toward IPE. barriers that could hinder the development of IPE included heavy teaching and administrative load and logistic arrangement for classroom arrangement and academic scheduling involving multiple faculties.

388,Investigating learner behavior is an increasingly important research topic in online learning. Learning styles and cognitive traits have been the subjects of research in this area. Although learning institutions use Learning Management Systems such as Moodle. Claroline. and Blackboard to facilitate teaching. the platforms do not have features for analyzing data and identifying behavior such as learning styles and cognitive traits. Instead. they only produce certain statistical reports from the daily access records. Even though complex models have been proposed in the literature. most studies are based on a single behavior such as learning styles or cognitive traits but not both. Only a few have investigated a combination of cognition-based theories such as working memory capacity and psychology-based ones such as learning styles. Thus. this study sought to answer the research question of whether it was possible to establish a methodology for the estimation of learning styles and cognitive traits from a learning management system. The study combined the Felder-Silverman Learning Style Model and Cognitive Trait Model as theoretical frameworks to identify behavior in a Learning Management System. This study designed a model for extracting records from Learning Management Systems access records to estimate learning style and cognitive traits. From this. a prototype was developed to estimate the learning style and cognitive traits for each student. The model was evaluated by administering manual tools to students in a classroom environment then comparing the results gathered against those estimated by the model. The results analyzed using Kappa statistics demonstrated the interrater reliability results were moderately in agreement. Taken together. these results suggest that it is possible to estimate the learning styles and cognitive traits of a learner in a Learning Management System. The information generated by the model can be used by tutors to provide a conducive online learning environment where learners with similar behavior ask each other for help. This can reduce the teaching load for online tutors because learners themselves act as a teaching resource. Information on learning styles and cognitive styles can also facilitate online group formation by isolating the individual factors that contribute to team success.

389,"The importance of academics undertaking research and publishing their research results is emphasised by universities. Engagement in research is recognised as an effective means to increase a university's profile. This study applied a qualitative approach to explore affordances. barriers. and motivations towards the engagement in research experienced by academics at one of the leading universities in Vietnam. Nineteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with academics whose academic rank. discipline. qualification. age. and gender are different. A thematic analysis of the data discovered four institutional factors hindering the engagement in research of academics: financial support for research activities (affordance), teaching load (barrier), research collaboration (motivation), and research policy settings and practices (motivation). The findings revealed that a majority of the respondents were aware of the importance of research but their research productivity is still low because of problems related to such institutional factors. The findings are useful in assisting leaders of the investigated university to understand the research motivation of its academics as well as ascertain barriers to which academics are facing that can be overcome through intervention. Such understanding helps them to improve the policy for research across this university which is predicted to enhance the research productivity of all academics. PU  - ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS.

Two of the main challenges are to learn to regulate the highly complex classroom situations (Jones. 2006) and to regulate their own emotional resources (Chang. 2009). Accordingly. in the present study. we investigated changes in teacher candidates' classroom management knowledge as well as emotional exhaustion at the beginning of their teaching careers. We applied latent change models to a sample of 746 teacher candidates who were assessed twice during the German induction phase (the Referendariat). We found evidence for a significant increase in teacher candidates' classroom management knowledge during the induction phase. Emotional exhaustion increased during the first year and decreased during the second year of the induction phase. We also investigated between-person differences in the changes. Classroom management knowledge was predicted by the teacher candidates' cognitive personal characteristics (e.g.. cognitive abilities and willingness to reflect). whereas emotional exhaustion was predicted by noncognitive personal characteristics (e.g.. emotional stability) as well as variables related to the induction phase (e.g.. perceived mentoring quality and teaching load). Classroom management knowledge and emotional exhaustion were only modestly associated. PU  - ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE PI  - SAN DIEGO PA  - 525 B ST. STE 1900. SAN DIEGO.

392,Purpose To investigate faculty integration of service-learning into radiologic science curricula and its effects on faculty and students.Methods An online survey was distributed to radiologic science faculty to assess the status of service-learning in radiologic science education. Invitations were sent to 2351 faculty in diagnostic medical sonography. nuclear medicine technology. radiation therapy. and radiography programs. Quantitative analysis using descriptive statistics was performed on the raw data. and mind maps were created from responses to open-ended questions for qualitative analysis.Results A total of 444 surveys were returned. for a 19{\%} response rate. Faculty who incorporated service-learning into their courses reported outcomes of increased professionalism. leadership. career skills. empathy. and community awareness. Primary deterrents for integrating service-learning into curricula were lack of faculty and student time and logistical challenges.Discussion The most profound professional benefits of service-learning reported were increased community awareness and relationships among faculty. community. and students. Faculty also indicated that service-learning improved professional effectiveness in terms of knowledge and application. Survey results indicated that service-learning provides students with experiences relevant to the environment they will encounter after graduation. Faculty who use service-learning reported additional benefits for themselves and their students. including having a richer understanding of the community and its members. which ultimately improves critical soft-skills of practice.Conclusion Faculty who use service-learning in their courses and those who plan to use it in the future reported that logistical management and institutional support in the form of release time (ie. counting course development time toward teaching load requirements) are of paramount importance. This type of support would help engage faculty in developing and maintaining service-learning coursework. PU  - AMER SOC RADIOLOGIC TECHNOLOGISTS PI  - ALBUQUERQUE PA  - 15000 CENTRAL AVE. SE.

This is a complex problem. usually solved by means of heuristic algorithms. In this paper a Mixed Integer Linear Programing model is developed to balance teachers' teaching load (first optimization criterion). while maximizing teachers' preferences for courses according to their category (second optimization criterion). The model is used to solve the teachers-courses assignment in the Department of Management at the School of Industrial Engineering of Barcelona. in the Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya. Results are discussed regarding the importance given to the optimization criteria. Moreover. to test the model's performance a computational experiment is carried out using randomly generated instances based on real patterns. Results show that the model is proven to be suitable for many situations (number of teachers-courses and weight of the criteria). being useful for departments with similar requests.

394,For nurturing students' sound science view it is essential to teach with integrated science curriculum and instruction material. Korean Science Curriculum has been modified with integrated science subject. It still needs further integration because contents of integration are not enough to accomplish complete science contents integration. Inquiry centered integration would be helpful but there are some weak points because of limited number of appropriate science contents for inquiry centered integration. Science centered integration is needed for many reason. Some of them are as follows: Firstly. Science responds to children's need to learn about the world around them. Secondly student's everyday experience is the foundation for science. For elementary school teachers who should teach many specified subject science centered integration instruction material would lessen teachers' teaching load. The lesson plans which are developed in this study would be help to elementary teachers. PU  - The Korean Society of Biology Education
395,University course timetabling problem (UCTP) includes the challenging task of generating an automated timetable for courses under resource limitations. Manual generated timetables might hold some errors and consume a long time to create feasible solutions. Thus. there is a need to find optimal and fast solutions for this problem. The difficulty of the timetabling problem is further increased when tackling faculty-related constraints. according to their requirements. preferences. and availability. Thus. student-related constraints are usually the focus of UCTP generated solutions. in which faculty constraints are limited to their teaching load or preferences. This paper proposes a multi-objective mixed-integer programming model for a preregistration UCTP. combined with faculty-related constraints. The goal is to maximize events assignments and faculty-members preferences satisfaction while balancing the university requirements. At the same time. student learning days and unassigned events are minimized. The model is tested with eight real-world instances. Computational experiments are carried out to show the efficiency of the model. The proposed method can generate optimal timetables for all problem instances that satisfy faculty constraints.

396,As the pillars of knowledge. universities are required to pursue and expand our understanding of phenomena. This implies that universities should apart from teaching and community involvement be actively engaged in research-related activities. It often happens that factors such as a heavy teaching load and a lack of focus affects the amount of time spend on research-related activities. It is therefore necessary that research should be a purpose-driven process that should be considered at both strategic and departmental level. By using organisational culture literature. specific the three-level typology of Schein (1992). this article aims to identify values that should be incorporated into the culture of both faculties and the wider university to aid the development of a research culture. Values are tangible and are therefore a measurable part of organisational culture. If the proposed values are incorporated a sustained research culture could be created.

397,OBJECTIVES: Our primary objective was to describe the pulse oximetry discharge thresholds used by general and pediatric emergency physicians for well-appearing children with bronchiolitis and pneumonia. and to assess the related practice variability.METHODS: This mail-in survey was conducted in August and September 2001 and included the 281 active members of the Pediatric Emergency Medicine Section of the American College of Emergency Physicians. The survey consisted of 2 case scenarios of previously healthy. well-appearing children: a 2-year-old with pneumonia and a 10-month-old with bronchiolitis. Respondents were asked about their years of experience. teaching load. percentage of children in their practice. whether they currently have a written departmental guideline at their institution. and the lowest pulse oximetry reading that they would accept and still discharge the patient directly home.RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-two (65{\%}) physicians answered the survey and met the inclusion criteria. The respondents' median oximetry value and interquartile range (IQR) for the pneumonia and bronchiolitis cases were 93{\%} (92{\%}-94{\%}) and 94{\%} (92{\%}-94{\%}) respectively. With the exception of the 3 physicians practising {\textgreater}1000 metres above sea level. the responses by subgroups were similar.CONCLUSIONS: There does not yet exist a safe. clinically validated pulse oximetry discharge threshold. Emergency physicians from this study sample have a modest degree of practice variability in a self-reported pulse oximetry discharge threshold. Emergency physicians may use this data to compare their own practice with that reported by this group.

399,The study aims to promote the knowledge creation activities for the under developing countries like Ethiopia. which is the need of the hour. Faculty members' participation in research not only helps in improving the quality of faculty members but also improves the quality of the institute. In this paper. we use survey data from Wollega University to understand the factors hindering the research participation decision of faculty members at the university level. This survey tries to analyse the determinants of participation of academic staff in Wollega University. The logit model was used for analysing the data. We conclude that availability of publication incentives. work experience. speed of internet. accessibility to research funds and colleague collaboration on research participation all enhance the probability of academic staff's research participation while teaching load is negatively related to the probability of academic staff's research participation in the study area.

400,Objective: To pilot-test feasibility. acceptance and learning-outcomes of a brief interdisciplinary communication skills training program in undergraduate medical education.Methods: A two-hour interdisciplinary communication skills program with simulated patients was developed and pilot-tested with clinical students at Hamburg University. Five psychosocial specialties facilitated the training. Composite effects were measured qualitatively and quantitatively.Results: Eighty students volunteered to participate in the pilot-program (intervention-group). Their evaluations of the program were very positive (1.1 on a six-point scale). Benefits were seen in feedback. increase of self-confidence. cross-disciplinary clinical and communication experience. Students who did not volunteer (n = 206) served as the control-group. The intervention-group performed significantly better (p = 0.023) in a primary care communication examination and female students performed better than males. Clinical teachers evaluated the pilot-training very positively with regard to learning-outcomes and feasibility. The positive results from the pilot-training led to implementation into the regular curriculum.Conclusions: A two-hour interdisciplinary communication skills training program is beneficial for medical students with regard to communication competencies. self-confidence and learning-outcomes.Practice implication: The training is feasible within given time-frames and limited staff resources. The high teaching load for small-group-training are split between five specialties. The concept might be an interesting option for other faculties. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

401,This paper presents a teaching case of a Blended Learning (DL) approach that was applied to a course on Method Engineering (ME) intended for graduate Business Informatics (BIS) students. The main reason for transforming a Master course on ME from traditional to blended is to take advantage of combining frontal instruction with e-learning based instruction and at the same time reducing lecturers' workload in times of increasing student numbers in BIS and Computer Science (CS) areas. The BL approach consists of three parts. as it consists of the introduction of computer-supported peer assessment. interactive e-lectures. and digital examination. The approach has been reflected upon by course lecturers themselves and it was evaluated through two separate student surveys. from which a variety of positive outcomes can be deduced. Increased generation of feedback. an increase in student motivation. and improved understanding of the course content are three of these outcomes that stand out. On top of student related advantages. especially the BE parts concerning peer assessment and digital examination reduce teaching load. These findings are informative for both education researchers and instructors who are interested in embedding BE in BIS or CS education. PU  - IEEE PI  - NEW YORK PA  - 345 E 47TH ST. NEW YORK.

402,The inequities faced by women in academic Medicine before the COVID-19 pandemic are well established. However. there is little formal data regarding exactly how the pandemic has affected faculty. This cross-sectional study investigated the impact of the pandemic on responsibilities at home. work. and mental health according to gender identification. faculty rank. and faculty appointment. In February 2021. an online questionnaire was broadly distributed to academic medicine faculty. Respondents were asked to provide demographic data. answer questions about their responsibilities at home and work. mental health. and how the pandemic has influenced these. Respondents were also asked to document what their institution(s) can do to help faculty through the pandemic. Responses were analyzed via Pearson's chi-square tests and thematic analysis. Women faculty were more likely to be responsible for the care of others (70{\%}. p = 0.014). and the impact was negative. especially for early career faculty (p = 0.019). Productivity in research. teaching. and clinical practice were negatively impacted. with women feeling this in clinical practice (p = 0.005). increased teaching load (p = 0.042). and inadequate work environment (p = 0.013). In the areas of self-care and mental health. women (p {\textless} 0.001). early career-faculty (p {\textless} 0.001). and clinical faculty (p = 0.029) were more negatively impacted. Early-career women were more likely to fear retribution. Five themes emerged. including Flexible Expectations. Support. Mental Health. Compensation. and Communication. Pre-pandemic stress and burnout were rampant. and this study demonstrates that academic medicine faculty are still suffering. It is the authors' hope that administrations can utilize these data to make informed decisions regarding policies enacted to assist populations who are most vulnerable to the effects of the pandemic.

404,Research on academic expatriation has rarely investigated the drivers of academic performance in a foreign cultural environment. This study focuses on research productivity as a crucial facet of performance and integral part of academic jobs. Drawing from the job demands-resources model. we position perceived organizational support and the number of doctoral students supervised as resources and teaching and service load as demands of self-initiated expatriate (SIE) academics' jobs. Most importantly. we suggest that being cross-culturally adjusted is a vital personal resource living and working in a foreign country and that cross-cultural adjustment moderates the effects of demands and resources. The analysis of combined survey and publication data from 208 SIE academics in natural sciences indicates that the number of doctoral students supervised increases research productivity. while teaching load reduces it. Moreover. findings show that cross-cultural adjustment amplifies the effects of demands and resources. The implications of these findings are discussed. PU  - WILEY PERIODICALS.

406,Purpose - This paper seeks to determine attitudes that impact on knowledge transfer between academics (university teaching and research staff) employed in today's competitive. technology-based university setting.Design/methodology/approach - The study generated a rich set of data by conducting. first. an exploratory. qualitative study followed by a confirmatory. quantitative study Through this process. an initial list of 402 attitudes to knowledge transfer was derived which was narrowed to 75 for the quantitative survey which. through factor analysis. was further reduced to 24 variables. The 24 variables were grouped into four factors for which trust and motivation are more relevant to the knowledge provider and absorptive capacity and knowledge regeneration for the receiverFindings - High levels of agreement were found for the propositions that senior academics lacked compensation for mentoring activities. and hence. the motivation to transfer knowledge. and that a heavy teaching load prevented the absorption of transferred knowledge. By contrast. disagreement was found with the propositions that an elderly age impeded the transfer of knowledge or adapting to new ways of transferring knowledge.Practical implications - From the responses obtained it was possible to identify those rated highly and from which conclusions could be drawn that may assist the university concerned to improve knowledge transfer among its academic staff. Compensation to senior academics for their time and effort was seen as the most important pre-requisite for knowledge transfer A reduction in teaching loads and the range of expectations to which academics are subjected would also facilitate knowledge transfer as would increasing academics' use of ICT and ability to assess its effectiveness. as well as recognising that knowledge transfer during social interactions may ameliorate the lack of knowledge transfer in the more formal. technology-based environment.Originality/value - The paper identifies key attitudes of academics to transferring knowledge to colleagues in the changing work place at universities in which academics are expected to perform at a high level in diverse activities and use technology to maximise their efficiency and effectiveness.

407,Background: In medical education. a learner-centred approach is recommended. There is also a trend towards workplace-based learning outside of the hospital setting. In Australia. this has resulted in an increased need for General Practitioner (GP) supervisors who are receptive to using adult learning principles in their teaching. Little is known about what motivates Australian GP supervisors and how they currently teach.Methods: A qualitative study involving semi-structured interviews with 20 rural GP supervisors who work within one Regional Training Provider region in Australia explored their reasons for being a supervisor and how they performed their role. Data was analysed using a thematic analysis approach.Results: GP supervisors identified both personal and professional benefits in being a supervisor. as well as some benefits for their practice. Supervision fulfilled a perceived broader responsibility to the profession and community. though they felt it had little impact on rural retention of doctors. While financial issues did not provide significant motivation to teach. the increasing financial inequity compared with providing direct patient care might impact negatively on the decision to be or to remain a supervisor in the future.The principal challenge for supervisors was finding time for teaching. Despite this. there was little evidence of supervisors adopting strategies to reduce teaching load. Teaching methods were reported in the majority to be case-based with styles extending from didactic to coach/facilitator. The two-way collegiate relationship with a registrar was valued. with supervisors taking an interest in the registrars beyond their development as a clinician.Conclusion: Supervisors report positively on their teaching and mentoring roles. Recruitment strategies that highlight the personal and professional benefits that supervision offers are needed. Practices need assistance to adopt models of supervision and teaching that will help supervisors productively manage the increasing number of learners in their practices. Educational institutions should facilitate the development and maintenance of supportive supervision and a learning culture within teaching practices. Given the variety of teaching approaches. evaluation of in-practice teaching is recommended. PU  - BMC PI  - LONDON PA  - CAMPUS. 4 CRINAN ST. LONDON N1 9XW. ENGLAND
408,Introduction. This research carried out a comparative study between three countries severely impacted by the coronavirus based on the analysis of the reflections of teachers and students on university virtual teaching during the confinement stage. Methodology. This descriptive. exploratory and explanatory study applied surveys. between March and April 2020. to students and teachers of Journalism. Communication and Education at the Autonomous University of Barcelona (Spain). University of Turin (Italy). and Technical University of Machala (Ecuador). The survey had responses from 300 students (100 per country) and 196 teachers. Results. The majority of students negatively value the move to virtuality. since it is associated. regularly. with an increase in the teaching load. E-learning has contributed to negatively impacting the view of students on their trainers. while the latter demands basic digital skills in young university students. Discussion. According to the research results. teachers. in the scenario of remote training. must show knowledge not only about the content of the subject but also technological and digital-pedagogical knowledge. Conclusions. The teacher must be able to innovate. reflect and transform their didactic proposals to respond to the social demands that the world is experiencing during a health crisis while achieving the curricular objectives proposed at the beginning of the course. On the other hand. the surveyed teachers recognize that it is necessary to promote critical and reflective thinking linked to the strategic management of ICT.

410,"This research initiative was motivated by a reflective analysis of the deficiencies observed during the teaching-learning process. It aims to provide effective and efficient solutions to minimize. or better yet. eliminate these problems. The primary deficiencies observed were: a procedural deficit in students' key competencies. suitability of computer tools utilized in the teaching-learning process. and teachers' excessive teaching load. To address the first issue. an educational socialization approach was adopted by means of practical learning experiences in professional contexts. This type of experience is intended to foster students' vocational motivation. which is considered crucial to motivating their commitment to learning. An eclectic methodology is proposed based on a combination of three didactic proposals: academic tutoring. programmed teaching. and modular learning. Each learning approach comprises three stages: introduction. development and results.Firstly. the various development stages of the Teaching Innovation Project are described (preliminary actions. design of activities. implementation and reengineering), then. the results obtained are outlined. And lastly. the conclusions are presented. which confirm some of the hypotheses: modular learning proved to be a flexible methodology capable of adapting to different learning environments. whereas an excessively large number of participants greatly complicated work groups' internal functioning. Furthermore. this study identified students' preferences regarding computer applications to be incorporated into collaborative work.

412,"The article touches upon the changes in roles within the academic profession in Russia arising from the education and science reform. The analysis is made through the example of the National Research University Higher School of Economics (HSE). Both quantitative and qualitative data is used to suggest a typology of faculties based on their work time allocation. The typology includes five types of faculties: teacher researchers. teachers. researchers. ""universal soldiers"". and experts. Each type displays different levels of satisfaction with their work time budget: those who do a lot of teaching and administrative work tend to be less satisfied. This can be explained by the changes in the system of faculty certification in Russia and by how academic staff respond to those changes. Interview results are used to highlight the typical work time allocation problems faced by faculties. These include a low degree of freedom to manage one's own work time. the lack of boundary in work-life balance. excessive teaching load. an increase in unscheduled tasks. and the problem of delegating workloads which require high research and management skills.

414,This paper considers the problem of assigning faculty to courses at a university. Traditional operations research methods emphasizing the use of mathematical models suffer several shortcomings. including poor handling of qualitative data. undue abstraction from the problem. difficulty of problem formulation. and the combinatorial problem. This paper presents a knowledge-based system (KBS) approach to the faculty-course assignment problem that is believed to offer advantages over previous mathematical scheduling methods. A variety of criteria such as course preferences by faculty. scheduled course offerings. faculty teaching load and maximum number of days an instructor teaches per week are considered in developing the model. This KBS was applied to a department in a major university. and real-world faculty-course assignment examples were used to illustrate the model's potential. The KBS's recommendations were subsequently validated by the course coordinators. The system demonstrates that KBSs can be an effective tool for faculty-course scheduling.

415,Though related to a specific concept in transition. the theme of this article is part of a more global reflection on inclusive education. With special education teachers and students being reintegrated into the regular classroom. the concept of coeducation has been in the spotlight in recent years. The objective of this article is to put the effectiveness and framework conditions of coeducation in perspective and to bring out the research perspectives needed to support or refute current guidelines for the implementation of inclusive coeducation. We will first position the problem in the Swiss context. and then define the key concepts of co-education in relation to the intensity of methods of sharing the teaching load. We will then present the results of several related studies on the effectiveness of coeducation in terms of school results and student behaviour. along with the benefits perceived by the students and teachers. We will then show the framework conditions recommended by different authors for putting coeducation in place in the classroom.

However. only a few studies concerning the challenges and benefits of doing research have been conducted in the Philippines and the ASEAN region. This study explores the experiences of Philippine public school teachers in conducting a school or a classroom research project. The data were collected through individual interviews administered to 11 public high school English teachers in Mindanao. Philippines. Findings suggest that although teachers' motivations to do research were more personal rather than professional. teachers recognised some benefits of doing school and classroom-based research for their teaching practices and career development. Challenges that were reported include the lack of financial support. heavy teaching load. lack of research skills and knowledge. and lack of research materials and resources. Implications are discussed in light of the findings and recommendations formulated for future research directions.

417,Recent research indicated that students' ability to construct evidence-based explanations in classrooms through scientific inquiry is critical to successful science education. Structured argumentation support environments have been built and used in scientific discourse in the literature. To the best of our knowledge. no research work in the literature addressed the issue of automatically assessing the student's argumentation quality. and the teaching load of the teacher that used the online argumentation support environments is not alleviated. In this work. an intelligent argumentation assessment system based on machine learning techniques for computer supported cooperative learning is proposed. Learners' arguments on discussion board were examined by using argumentation element sequence to detect whether the learners address the expected discussion issues and to determine the argumentation skill level achieved by the learner. Learners are first assigned to heterogeneous groups based on their responses to the learning styles questionnaire given right before the beginning of learning activities on the e-learning platform. A feedback rule construction mechanism is used to issue feedback messages to the learners in case the argumentation assessment system detects that the learners go in a biased direction. The Moodle. an open source software e-learning platform. was used to establish the cooperative learning environment for this study. The experimental results exhibit that the proposed work is effective in classifying and improving student's argumentation level and assisting the students in learning the core concepts taught at a natural science course on the elementary school level.

418,"Objective: To ascertain the teaching load of general practices. the capacity for expansion of general practice-based teaching and the support required to achieve this.Design. setting and participants: Questionnaire-based survey of general practitioners and practices who were teaching medical students. junior doctors or GP registrars in partnership with the Adelaide to Cutback GP Training Program or the Discipline of General Practice at the University of Adelaide in South Australia in 2007.Main outcome measures: Current teaching load of general practices, GPs' reasons for teaching, capacity of practices to increase teaching loads, and support required to realise practices' full teaching capacity.Results: In 2007. the 76 practices involved in the survey taught. in total. 326 medical students. 39 junior doctors and 84 GP registrars. Exposing students and doctors to general practice was cited most often by the 194 GP respondents as the reason for teaching. Few practices rated the support payments for teaching as adequate or fairly adequate. A number of practices were able to increase their teaching load within their current levels. with most being able to teach more medical students (39{\%} of practices) or registrars (42{\%} of practices). All practices able to increase their teaching load stated that their capacity to expand was conditional on extra resources. including more physical space. subsidies and teachers.Conclusion: Scope exists to increase teaching in the general practices surveyed and is related to the level. or levels. of teaching undertaken by the practices. Targeted support seems essential if practices are to increase their teaching load. MJA 2009, 191: 102-104 PU  - AUSTRALASIAN MED PUBL CO LTD PI  - PYRMONT PA  - LEVEL 2. 26-32 PYRMONT BRIDGE RD.

419,"This paper considers the relationship between assessment method and teaching method and shows that alignment of assessment and teaching methods provides opportunities for significant increase in graduate quality and simultaneous decrease in teaching load and resource costs. The paper is based on both formal reviews of programmes in a range of disciplines including architecture. engineering. law. medicine and science. in universities in Australia. Europe and North America. and collaborative research involving linear and cross-sectional studies of teachers. programmes and successive cohorts of students in those disciplines. These reviews and research have shown that institutional reforms including new teaching methods intended to achieve greater relevance and student satisfaction. new assessment methods intended to meet accreditation and quality assurance requirements. and organisational restructuring of faculties intended to achieve ""efficiencies"". have all failed to achieve sustainable benefit. Worse. in many cases these interventions have been counterproductive and have resulted in ""quality failure"" and teacher. resource and student overload. The paper also shows that. if the assessment and teaching methods are not aligned to precisely the same expected outcomes. then the very best teaching methods are rendered ineffective. wasteful of teachers' skills and efforts. and expensive. Various outcome factors contribute to this effect. including types of knowledge and skills involved. engagement of various student thinking and learning patterns. and intended attitude and value systems. The paper shows that alignment of the teaching and assessment methods to precisely the same outcome factors provides opportunities for significant improvement in both student satisfaction and quality of graduates. and opportunities for significant reduction in teaching and resource load. The paper presents a new teacher-driven. ""bottom-up"" approach to the three factors at the top of the agenda in higher education throughout the Developed World: relevance of content. quality of graduates and economy of teaching load and resource costs, and to student satisfaction which is a fourth factor of increasing importance.

421,"The study sought to explore educator views on implementation practices of life orientation skills education (LSE) for senior high school students. Participants were 15 guidance and counselling teachers from a rural district of Eswatini (females = 7). The educators responded to semi-structured questions and focus group discussion interviews on the life orientation skills implementation practices they engaged in. Thematic analysis of the data indicated the educators to consider the following important to their implementation practices: knowledge and skills practices in guidance and counselling, training in basic counselling skills, and motivation to effectively implement LSE. The educators considered content knowledge and pedagogy skills important for effective teaching of decision-making and problem-solving skills to students. They also perceived training in basic counselling skills such as listening. acceptance. and empathising as important for teaching of LSE, as well as the incentivising of LSE through extra-compensation and reduction of teaching load. The educators perceived further training needs in basic counselling skills and supplemental material resources to enhance implementation of LSE. These findings suggest a need for continuing professional development of educators to better equip them for sustainable LSE implementation practices with high school students.

422,The purpose of this paper is twofold: To measure school technical efficiency and to identify the determinants of elementary school performance among Mexican states. Our panel data consist of 48.645 public elementary schools observed annually from 2009 to 2011. a period where subnational states administered most of the educational expenditure. We propose a two-stage analysis. In the first stage. the stochastic frontier analysis is used to calculate elementary schools' technical efficiency. In the second stage. efficiency is regressed on school characteristics and environmental variables using panel data analysis while capturing state heterogeneity. We find that primary schools have important inputs under their control that affects educational outcomes. The principal's non-teaching load. infrastructure. teaching experience. and expenditure per student all have a positive and significant effect on efficiency. As for state-level characteristics. we find that states' primary school spending is not necessarily positively linked to efficiency. Finally. we observe that fragmentation and regionalization of teachers' unions negatively affect efficiency in elementary public education. PU  - UNIV NACIONAL AUTONOMA MEXICO.

423,With the popularity of embedded systems and the consequently rising demand in the job market for professionals well-versed in them. embedded operating systems (EOSs) have become one of the core courses in computer science studies across the world. The objective of EOS courses is to develop students' ability to port. modify. and customize an embedded operating system through a series of laboratory exercises. However. our teaching experience has revealed that beginners require a considerable amount of time to familiarize themselves with the development environment and the relevant processes. such as operating in a command line interface. setting environment variables. and kernel configurations. Furthermore. students need to constantly handle compiler error messages. malfunctions of the target EOS. and incompatibility issues related to development tools. These problems may frustrate and discourage students. A common strategy to address this problem is to dedicate more hours to teaching or to hire more teaching assistants to help students progress. However. none of these methods is suitable for institutions with limited resources. Therefore. in this paper. we develop a computer-assisted learning system called the Computer-assisted Learning Environment (CALEE) to assist students with their assignments and thus motivate them. CALEE consists of two parts: a self-learning assistant (SLAT) and a collaborative learning website (CLW). SLAT is a software application that provides a set of useful functions to help students perform EOS laboratory exercises. whereas the collaborative learning website seeks to encourage greater interaction among students. Our experiments show that CALEE expedites learning. improves students' motivation. and reduces the teaching load. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The present study applies a distributed perspective to leadership and investigates aspects of information and communications technologies coordinator context that would facilitate leadership. Twenty-seven information and communications technologies coordinators were surveyed on their schools' structures and mechanisms that mediate their leadership practice. Descriptive statistics show that a wide range of structures and mechanisms in different quantities and with different qualities can be available to coordinators. The majority of coordinators have neither additional position roles nor a teaching load. but the coordinators have organizational unit assignments and attend daily. routine interactions. A case study illustrates how specific structures and mechanisms would facilitate leadership for information and communications technologies implementation. It is recommended to design an information and communications technologies coordinator role as a formal position role. for a school to employ more than one information and communications technologies coordinator. and to develop an information and communications technologies coordinator's teaching load. organizational unit assignments and routine interactions according to school needs. Several possible populations of information and communications technologies coordinators are identified for further research.

426,"With the continuous improvement of the network hardware environment. people turn the demand target to the network application environment and the construction of information resources. How to build a network teaching platform for general undergraduate teaching to ensure the stability of the system and high-quality services during operation especially large-scale concurrent access will inevitably lead to the increase in the business volume of each core part of the network. the number of visits. and data traffic. With the growth of the network. the corresponding processing power and computing intensity also increase rapidly. which causes problems such as overloading of core network equipment. network bottlenecks. and network congestion. Simply pursuing high-performance hardware to solve problems will undoubtedly result in high cost investment, moreover. equipment with excellent performance cannot meet the needs of the current rapidly growing business volume. According to the design goal of the dance online teaching platform. to meet the online teaching load requirements of many people at the same time. the pressure of the web server cluster must be great. Because many people in online at the same time put too much pressure on the web server. this part of the network cannot be processed in time. which leads to the phenomenon that the performance of this part and even the whole network is degraded. In severe cases. it will even cause network communication services to come to a standstill. that is. the so-called deadlock phenomenon. If the protocol software cannot detect congestion and reduce the packet sending rate. the network will be paralyzed due to congestion. This situation will cause the problem of movement delay for online dance teaching. which will seriously affect the quality of teaching. Therefore. the dance online course system should be continuously improved. the quality of online courses should be continuously improved. and the study of the practical application of load balancing technology in the network teaching environment has become an important means to solve the relationship between supply and demand of network teaching. According to the experimental analysis. when the number of Worker' actuators is fixed. the execution time span of MakeSpan increases with the increase of tasks. while the time required by the optimized load balancing algorithm proposed in this paper increases by 1.32 s on average with the increase of tasks. and the time required by heuristic algorithm and bee colony algorithm increases by 3.68 s and 3.45 s on average with the increase of tasks. On the whole. the optimized load balancing algorithm proposed in this paper has obvious advantages. PU  - HINDAWI LTD PI  - LONDON PA  - ADAM HOUSE. 3RD FLR. 1 FITZROY SQ. LONDON. W1T 5HF. ENGLAND"
427,The topic of this paper reflects the real needs and stipulated priorities within foreign language teaching at the Faculty of Economics and Management of the Czech University of Life Sciences Prague. One of the priorities in the field of education is the reduction of the lecturer's direct teaching load. which is connected with the use of modern ICT technologies. e-learning courses for full-time forms of studies. for distance studies and for the centres of lifelong learning outside Prague. For the purposes of the research. the e-learning course was developed.The objective of the research was to find out students' opinion on e-learning depending on the frequencies of their responses and on their qualitative signs.Statistically significant differences in the responses to questions are supposed to be caused by the personal experience of the students. who took part in the e-learning course and who could better judge the questions. and on the other hand. by the lack of experience of those who did not take part in the course. Most students who took part in the course supported the inclusion of the e-learning course in the distance studies and thought that the studies through the e-learning method could be as effective as through the face-to-face method.

428,The mastery of English is currently considered inescapable to achieve the internationalization of students and improve their work expectations. This study analyzes the perspective of university professors in Experimental Sciences regarding the employment of English as a medium of instruction (EMI) in the classroom in order to facilitate its implementation in this field. The results were obtained through an online survey. Teaching load reduction. training provision and economic incentives are the aids most valued by the academic staff for teaching in English. The main difficulties encountered by the academics using EMI in the classroom are related to the low level of English of the students and. to a lesser extent. to their own lack of command of this language. The results obtained show the importance of the available services in the Universidad de Alicante (UA) and Universidad Miguel Hernandez (UMH) for the revision/translation of teaching material.

429,"Of all teaching methods. one-to-one human tutoring is the most powerful method for promoting learning. To achieve this aim and reduce teaching load. researchers developed intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) to employ one-to-one tutoring (Aleven. McLaren. {\&} Sewall. 2009, Aleven. McLaren. Sewall. {\&} Koedinger. 2009, Anderson. Corbett. Koedinger. {\&} Pelletier. 1995, Anderson {\&} Reiser. 1985, Blessing. Gilbert.

However. most ITSs have restricted user interfaces. which confine reasoning strategies of students during problem solving. thus ignoring the fact that students could use dissimilar strategies to solve a given question. Furthermore. student learning problems could be diagnosed from the derivation of their answers. In order to interpret students' mathematical problem-solving behaviors. this study developed a Model-tracing Intelligent Tutor (MIT) to diagnose students' learning problems and provide learning feedback for individual students. A quasi-experiment was conducted in an elementary school to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. in which 124 fifth graders participated. The experimental results show that the model-tracing-based learning diagnosis system is significantly more helpful to the students in learning mathematics than the conventional web-based test in terms of learning achievements.

430,In this paper. we develop mixed-integer linear programming models for assigning the most appropriate teaching assistants to the tutorials in a department. The objective is to maximize the number of tutorials that are taught by the most suitable teaching assistants. accounting for the fact that different teaching assistants have different capabilities and each teaching assistant's teaching load cannot exceed a maximum value. Moreover. with optimization models. the teaching load allocation. a time-consuming process. does not need to be carried out in a manual manner. We have further presented a number of extensions that capture more practical considerations. Extensive numerical experiments show that the optimization models can be solved by an off-the-shelf solver and used by departments in universities.

432,Badminton is a very popular subject in Physical Education (PE). Many students enroll badminton courses in every semester which pose a tremendous teaching load to the instructors. The one-on-one guiding/feedback time provided by the instructor to each student is also greatly reduced. To overcome this challenge. some studies have tried to adopt pose recognition technique in teaching badminton. However. the lack of mobility and recognition accuracy problems hinder its applicability. To address this issue. a new pose recognition technique. OpenPose. was employed to develop a real-time pose recognition badminton teaching APP in this study. The APP was then installed on a mobile device to enhance badminton smash skill learning performance. The scores distribution of the experimental group shows majority of students achieved satisfactory performance. this implies the badminton teaching APP is helpful to all students no matter what their initial skill levels are.

433,Faculty members are crucial partners in promoting academic integrity at Canadian universities. but their needs related to academic integrity are neither well documented nor understood. To address this gap. we developed a mixed methods survey to gather faculty perceptions of facilitators and barriers to using the existing academic integrity procedures. policies. resources. and supports required to promote academic integrity. In this article. we report the data collected from 330 participants at four Canadian universities. Responses pointed to the importance of individual factors. such as duty to promote academic integrity. as well as contextual factors. such as teaching load. class size. class format. availability of teaching assistant support. and consistency of policies and procedures. in supporting or hindering academic integrity. We also situated these results within a micro (individual). meso (departmental). macro (institutional). and mega (community) framework. Results from this study contribute to the growing body of empirical evidence about faculty perspectives on academic integrity in Canadian higher education and can inform the continued development of existing academic integrity supports at universities.

434,It is essential for academic staffs to keep track of their publication records. Publication is seen to be the main resource for evaluation in the academic world. Besides. the publication criteria are mainly being evaluated for promotion and to access research grants from the institution or the government entities. The basis of this research is to unveil personal. behavioral and environmental factors using social cognitive theory (SCT) and by implementing the Viable System Model (VSM) as the diagnostic tool using cybernetic concept which is more viable to changes in the organization. which relate to key performance indicators (KPI) delivery on scholarly publications (SP). Thus. this study is aimed at investigating factors associated with publication productivity among the research university academic staffs by integrating VSM and SCT. This study applies qualitative method triangulated with quantitative method. The findings show that the most influential factors for the SP of Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) are age. gender. experience. rank. teaching load. collaboration. funding. resource. discipline and skill. The model was evaluated for the SP KPI monitoring process. which further can be used by public and private universities to improve the performance of their institution's publication.

435,The current study intends to investigate teachers' beliefs about the issues encountered by writing teachers when they assess writing skills at the University of Algiers2. It also examines the factors which lie behind these challenges. Understanding the nature of the perceived challenges of assessing writing is very important to rethink the assessment practices of writing skills. Therefore. this study addresses the following research question: what are teachers' beliefs about the issues encountered when assessing students' writing skills? In this concern. the researcher adopted mixed method research to collect data by using a questionnaire and a semi-structured interview with ten teachers of writing selected randomly in the English department at the University of Algiers 2. Findings revealed that almost all teachers viewed the process of assessing writing as a very challenging task. Examples of the difficulties identified in this research include students' language problems. teachers' confusion between focusing on the content or the form. time pressure. overloaded classes. and lack of sufficient time to assess students' writing skills. Regarding the reasons behind these perceived challenges. teachers believed that the abovementioned issues stemmed from the lack of participation in a professional development program. low teaching load. and students' lack of intensive practice. This research provided a set of pedagogical implications to overcome these issues by calling for an emphasis on the importance of teachers' participation in a professional development program. reinforcement of teachers' training in the field of assessment. and the encouragement of students' intensive practice. and a sufficient teaching load.

436,"The case for establishing a second medical school in Singapore is strong. Given the recent explosive advances in medicine and biology. Singapore has identified the life sciences as an area of great economic potential. and aspires to become a regional ""medical hub"" capable of achieving excellence in healthcare. medical education and biomedical research. The existing medical faculty at the National University of Singapore is currently taking in 230 students per year. creating a very heavy teaching load which. coupled with even heavier clinical duties. makes it extraordinarily difficult for staff members to derive professional satisfaction and to pursue research interests. Creating a second medical school will alleviate some of these problems. which have contributed in no small way to the exodus of experienced clinicians and teachers to the private sector. Perhaps more importantly. having a second medical school will permit direct comparisons of the relative merits of different approaches to medical education. healthcare. and administrative practices. This in turn should lead to improvements in all these areas. thereby creating working environments more likely to satisfy staff aspirations. improve medical education and enhance research. Concerns about possible ""unhealthy competition"" and ""costly duplication"" with the establishment of a second medical school are largely unfounded if resources are managed appropriately.

437,Evidence of participants' work-family interface seems consistent with expansionist theory principles (vis-a-vis conflict theory). Using archival data of 270 faculty members. this study sought to illuminate the influence of occupying multiple roles (paid worker. spouse-partner. and parent) and role quality (stress from household responsibilities and satisfaction with job autonomy and independence) on stress from work demands (teaching load. research-publishing. and committee work). Using only childless respondents. marital status and role quality did not predict work stress. Married-partnered workers with children reported less stress from research-publishing demands and committee work than childless married-partnered faculty. Stress from managing household responsibilities was positively related to stress from work demands. and satisfaction with job autonomy and independence was inversely related to stress from teaching load and research-publishing demands. Higher levels of autonomy and independence corresponded with lower levels of work stress even for workers whose jobs permitted relatively high levels of flexibility.

441,The purpose of this study was to make a case study of instructional consulting geared toward beginning elementary school teachers in the field of social studies. It? specifically meant to examine the awareness of beginning elementary school teachers about social studies instruction and their difficulties by having an in-depth interview. and a consulting model for social studies class was developed and applied in an effort to overcome the limits of existing instructional supervision. Instructional consulting is still in the rudimentary stage. and only the concept of it has been defined. That isn? yet prevailing. and there are no obvious guidelines about its procedure. either. The meaning of instructional consulting was discussed in this study. and an instructional consulting model tailored to the needs of beginning teachers was developed and applied instead of merely sticking with existing instructional supervision practices. And whether the model brought any changes to the social studies instruction of beginning teachers was checked.The selected beginning teachers. who had been learners in the past and then turned into teachers. faced lots of pressure due to the diversity of social studies. teaching load and the necessity of localization and individualization. and they also had difficulties in understanding the curriculum. instructional models and teaching methods and in preparing materials. There wasn? sufficient information on how to tide over the difficulties. and they found it difficult to seek a solution. Instructional consulting was provided for the beginning teachers to boost their instructional professionalism in social studies. and the instructional consulting that involved prior interview. preliminary diagnosis. instructional observation. instructional planning. instructional analysis. evaluation and feedback enabled the teachers to have a good understanding of the social studies curriculum and to formulate strategies about how to proceed with social studies class. At the same time. that made a contribution to the rearrangement of the social studies curriculum. the utilization of diverse instructional strategies. the diversity of evaluation and the improvement of teacher professionalism. and that ultimately made it possible to give a quality instruction. which could be called a good case.

443,BackgroundWith the rise in graduate unemployment and the poor linkage between university education and industry. competency-based training (CBT) is gaining popularity in Ghana's universities as a way of producing business-oriented and well-grounded graduates for industry who are ready to make use of knowledge acquired in university education to establish businesses that will help reduce unemployment in the country as well as working effectively in the nation's industry and service sectors. With CBT yet to be introduced in most Ghanaian tertiary institutions. information about academics' perception and willingness to adopt the methodology is crucial. This study examined the perception and adoption of CBT by academics in Ghana using cross-sectional data collected from 300 faculty members of Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST) using a structured questionnaire. Descriptive statistics. 5-point Likert scale. perception index. and the logit model were the methods of analysis employed.ResultsThe results of the survey showed that the overall perception index was 0.49. indicating that generally faculty members of KNUST agreed and had a positive perception of the potential of CBT in instilling in students employable skills. The logit results also showed that the probability of adoption of CBT is positively influenced by participation in CBT workshops. effective supervision of faculty members by university authorities. availability of teaching aids. and availability of incentives. Conversely. adoption was found to be negatively influenced by teaching load and number of undergraduate students per class.ConclusionsWe conclude that provision of appropriate teaching and learning resources that complement adoption of CBT. incentives. and competency-based education training for academics by university authorities and stakeholders in Ghana's tertiary education will enhance the adoption of CBT methodologies.

444,In this study we investigate college instructors' use of practices that facilitate interactions in online college courses. We begin by drawing on several strands of literature to offer a person purpose interaction framework with two dimensions - one regarding the entities involved in the interaction (instructor. student. content) and the other regarding the pedagogical goal of the interaction (academic. social. managerial) - that result in six sub-domains of practices. Subsequently. we examine the frequency of. and factors associated with instructors' use of these six domains. using survey data collected from online college instructors (N = 126) from a large community college. The results show that instructors using more interaction-oriented practices consistently have greater employment stability and teaching load. greater self-efficacy for using learning management systems. and greater perceived benefits of online learning for students. The findings have several implications for future research examining pedagogical behavior. as well as the design of professional development activities aimed at enhancing the use of effective online instructional practices among college instructors.

445,Using a theory of affordances. this study examines the introduction of e-books into the early literacy environment as resources that can increase children's opportunity for learning vocabulary. Added value was observed under conditions of (1) book browsing. (2) instruction. and (3) a print-only condition. A total of 33 4-year-olds (18 boys. 15 girls) from nine Head Start classrooms assigned to one of the three conditions participated over an 8-week period. Mean differences in target words learned in total and by mode in each condition were statistically significant in favor of the e-book-enriched environments. Differences in word learning between e-book environment conditions were clinically significant. Mean differences in words learned by total and by mode for children with varying levels of vocabulary knowledge (low. average. high) showed that those in e-book-enriched classrooms learned about 25{\%} of the target words with children with low vocabulary showing comparable gains. Results suggest added value of e-books in the early literacy environment: (1) affording children more exposure to target words to their advantage. (2) creating a choice of reading material in the early literacy environment. and (3) providing built-in scaffolds (e.g.. hotspots) that may carry some of the teaching load of vocabulary instruction.

446,This position paper describes the legal framework requirements when crediting digital teaching formats towards the teaching load in higher education medical teaching. as exemplified by the Federal State of Bavaria in Germany. It reveals the need for precise rules adapted to the advances in technology. if the process of digitalisation in higher education (HE) is not to come to a halt.If HE institutions are to act as centres of innovation with respect to the implementation of digital teaching and learning formats. then structural and strategic positioning with regard to e- and blended learning above all is called for in addition to financial resources. as well as the distribution and sustainable incorporation of digital offerings in faculties and HE institutions. There is a great deal of insecurity however with respect to the legal framework requirements and how best to count digital teaching towards ones own teaching load. This results to some extent from the complexity of current laws and regulations partially overtaken by didactic and methodological changes in education. with decentralised educational federalism only adding to the complexity. Bearing in mind teaching and learning formats that are undergoing change or have already been transformed. ways of adapting the (legal) framework to the digital shift need to be found. last but not least in order to offer enthusiastic teaching staff incentives to develop and expand digital formats.

448,"Background. As of October 1. 2003. a new government-initiated legislative basis for undergraduate medical education was initiated in Germany which resulted in substantial changes to the structure of the medical curriculum and in a heightened teaching load.Methods. The Medical Faculty of the University of Dresden established an interdisciplinary reform curriculum in 1998. Since then a hybrid model of traditional lectures. seminars. practical and problem-based learning courses has been implemented for all courses in undergraduate medical training (Dresdener Integrated Problem-based Learning: DIPOL{\&}REG,).Results. Exemplarily for all other DIPOL{\&}REG, courses. the 2003 evaluation results of the ""Emergency medicine - Injuries - Intensive care medicine"" are presented and show that the course was very well received by students and tutors. and that 95{\%} of the students passed the exams.Conclusions. The DIPOL{\&}REG, anesthesiology course conforms with the new German federal law. A continuous further evaluation is an essential part of quality control and is necessary for the further development of a new curriculum. PU  - SPRINGER PI  - NEW YORK PA  - 233 SPRING STREET.

449,In recent years. digital learning has been converting from e-learning to m-learning because of the significant growth of wireless and mobile computing technologies. Students can learn any time and any where with mobile devices. Consequently. context-aware ubiquitous learning (u-learning) is emerging as a new research area. It integrates wireless. mobile and context awareness technologies in order to detect the situation of the learners and provide more seamless adaptive support in the learning process. In this paper. a context-aware u-learning environment is developed for learning about campus vegetation in elementary schools based on an innovative approach by employing repertory grid method in designing learning content. In addition. we probe the feasibility of context-aware u-learning in courses by soliciting feedback from the students and teachers through interviews and questionnaires. The findings reveal that the environment is capable of enhancing students' motivation and learning effectiveness. Moreover. it is also capable of reducing the teaching load while enabling better control of class order. PU  - WILEY PI  - HOBOKEN PA  - 111 RIVER ST. HOBOKEN 07030-5774. NJ USA
450,The opening of a new medical school is a cause for celebration. Starting with a clean slate often gives the opportunity to adopt more modern teaching practices. However. encouraging large numbers of clinicians to start teaching and to adopt these new methods brings its own set of challenges.During the expansion phase of a new medical school. it was often noted that new teachers seemed to have considerable difficulties. and often expressed these as negativity towards student placements. This did not chime with much of the work from established schools. which seemed to evaluate expansion of teaching more positively. We wanted to better understand the issues involved.Semi-structured interviews were conducted involving GPs who had received medical students over the first four years of a newly established medical school. The aims were to assess the impact of the students on the new teachers. and to try to better understand why some teachers were experiencing difficulties. We collected qualitative and quantitative data at the interviews. The qualitative data were analysed using grounded theory which aims to link emerging themes together.The findings suggest that as the quantity of teaching medical students increases. the enjoyment and commitment to teaching may decrease. Concerns over the administration of teaching may begin to predominate. Two factors may help to reduce this:1 Adequate investment in manpower and premises to reduce time and space constraints on teaching.2 Practices considering themselves as teaching practices where education is a part of the practice identity.

451,"This paper presents a design for a cutting-edge English program in which elementary school learners of English as a foreign language in Taiwan had lively interactions with a teaching assistant robot. Three dimensions involved in the design included (1) a pleasant and interactive classroom environment as the learning context. (2) a teaching assistant robot designed and built by the researchers as instructional technology (instructional tool/medium). and (3) the need for improved motivation and learning outcomes and positive learning experiences of the students as the core research problem. This Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) led to better pedagogical effects on learning and teaching by (1) employing a vivid. enjoyable teaching approach, (2) adopting practical. interesting learning materials, and (3) creating a natural. enjoyable learning context. Both quantitative and qualitative findings of this study indicate that the students' English learning experiences were enhanced. as were their motivation and learning outcomes as a result of this HRI.

452,The international higher education sector is increasingly reliant on precariously employed non-tenured academic staff. Such staff are variously labelled as contingent. part-time. temporary or adjunct and. in Australia and New Zealand. as 'casual' or 'sessional' employees. The international trend is for these academics to deliver a significant proportion of teaching load. There is evidence that in some universities the majority of undergraduate courses are delivered by sessional academics. While there is evidence that these employees are typically committed to their teaching. their students and their discipline. there is little work on how their employment conditions affect the quality of teaching and learning. Previous research emphasises the conditions and experiences of academics so employed rather than the impact of such employment practices on their ability to deliver high quality teaching and learning outcomes. Thus further research in this area is necessary since this group of academic is increasingly pivotal in the learning experience of many students. particularly in the early years of higher education. In this research project a population of 130 sessional lecturers. tutors and markers in the disciplines of business and law at an Australian regional university were invited to participate in an online survey to report on their perceptions of their academic development and support. their teaching practices. and their motivation and satisfaction with their employment situation. The impact of these factors on the ability of such employees to deliver high quality teaching and learning outcomes for students is analysed. Results of the study are presented in the form of barriers and opportunities to improve teaching and learning for sessional academics.

453,This study explored the prioritization of English-medium instruction (EMI) teachers' needs for faculty development and institutional support by applying a best-worst scaling approach to an EMI program in Japan. This prioritization is important as EMI programs need management under various constraints (e.g.. time. budget. and teachers). This study also investigated how teachers' needs for institutional support differ by English language competence and EMI teaching experience and their relationship with EMI programs (e.g.. full-time or adjunct). Questionnaire surveys administered to 38 EMI teachers revealed that. overall. faculty development (FD) program menus training teaching styles. speaking skills. communication skills. and respecting the diversity of students should be prioritized such that it varies depending on the teachers' English language competence levels but not their teaching experience. Irrespective of their relationship with EMI programs. the recognition and appreciation of their burdens. efforts. and contributions is most needed. There are noticeable differences based on their position over the necessity of pedagogical guidelines. teaching load. and economic incentive. PU  - MDPI PI  - BASEL PA  - ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66.

455,While inequalities in scholarly productivity have long existed. the long-term implications on productivity due to the COVID-19 pandemic are not well documented. Using data from a survey of policing scholars. we conduct a mixed-methods analysis to determine the differential impacts of the pandemic on scholarly productivity. focusing on the intersectional effects by gender. childcare responsibilities. academic rank. and teaching load. Findings suggest that the effects of the pandemic were not evenly experienced by criminal justice and criminology researchers with the effects of productivity influenced by gender. rank and childcare responsibilities. We specifically discuss the longer-term implications of the pandemic on academic careers. PU  - ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS. TAYLOR {\&} FRANCIS LTD PI  - ABINGDON PA  - 2-4 PARK SQUARE. MILTON PARK.

456,Objectives: To identify the prevalence. factors and obstacles affecting research productivity among academic staff at medical and health colleges in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.Methods: This cross-sectional survey employed self-administered questionnaires to collect data on faculty members' profile. research activities. and obstacles impeding research productivity. The questionnaires were distributed randomly to 500 faculty members. of which 389 (77.8{\%}) completed the questionnaire at 10 medical and health colleges during January to April 2011. The data were analyzed and presented in a descriptive fashion.Results: Only 150 (38.6{\%}) respondents reported published work in the past 2 years. Of these. 80{\%} indicated sole-authors research and around a quarter (26{\%}) reported co-authors work. Males and young faculty members were more likely to publish research than their counterparts. Faculty members who reported involvement in administrative activities were less likely to publish. Those who reported supervising postgraduate students or had attained training on research methods were more likely to produce research. Respondents perceived that lack of time. lack of research assistants. lack of funds for research. and being busy with teaching load were the most cited obstacles impeding research productivity.Conclusion: Understanding factors and barriers impeding research productivity is a prerequisite for interventions that are directed to promote health services research among faculty members in medical schools.

461,Integrated Design for Marketability and Manufacturing (IDMM at Stanford) is an Integrated Product Development course (IPD at Michigan) that is distinguished by hands-on manufacture of customer-ready prototypes executed by cross-disciplinary teams of students (MBAs and graduate Engineering and Design students) in a simulated economic competition against benchmark products and against each other. The course design is such that teams can succeed only by performing well in each of the marketing. manufacturing. engineering. and design dimensions. Student failure modes include adopting the wrong product strategy. failure to execute a sound strategy of producing a product that meets market needs. failure to drive costs down. poor product positioning and/or communication. poor forecasting and inventory management. and poor team dynamics. Instructors adopting this course model will face challenges that derive from its definitively cross-functional nature. The course involves faculty from Business. Engineering. and Design in a world where teaching load. compensation and infrastructural support is most often tallied on a unit-specific basis. The course requires faculty with broad interests in a world in which narrow academic depth is often more highly valued. Other challenges the course presents include maintaining a sense of fairness in the final product competition. so that students can move beyond the anger of a potential failure to learn from their experience. Also. in its current manifestations on the Stanford and Michigan campuses the course requires expensive general-purpose machine tools and instruction for students to build fully functional (customer-ready) product prototypes. We provide our current resolutions to these challenges. and the rewards for making the effort. In the end. the course's survivability can be traced to the benefits it provides to all stakeholders: students. faculty. and administrators. These benefits include a course that integrates disciplines in a way that students believe will increase their integrative skills and marketability. a course that faculty can embrace as a vehicle for their own development in teaching and research. and that administrators find sufficiently novel and engaging to attract the attention of outside constituencies and the press.

462,Hospital efficiency is an important dimension for health services evaluation and suffers the influence of different non-discretionary variables. not necessarily under the control of the hospital manager. These must be considered when establishing goals for efficient and socially committed health. which in many countries is now the primary goal. To test and further understand the context of non-controllable variables in healthcare delivery. this study examined 104 teaching hospitals in Brazil. The efficiency score was generated using weight restricted-output oriented data envelopment analysis model. A second-stage logistic regression analysis was deployed to examine the predictors of efficiency among the non-discretionary variables. The efficiency results indicate that. it requires reduction in labor and in bed capacity. while it increases necessary admissions and high complexity procedures. The main predictors of efficiency were the size of the hospital. high teaching intensity. and low teaching dedication. The model predicts no association between efficiency and ownership. Teaching load. as an important source of qualified human resources to society. although associated with higher health costs. when not considered in service delivery. may distort the analysis of efficiency for the teaching hospitals. These findings could have implications for any healthcare system that has teaching hospitals among its components. PU  - ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS.

463,The impact of higher education reforms on teaching at faculty level in Germany has seldom been explored. Research on teaching at university so far centres on how to teach. Yet. before any (best) practice can take place. teaching requires a specific site where a specific teacher meets a specific number of students. To bring about teaching. teaching loads have to be matched with student numbers. which to a large degree depends on how existing policies interact. Drawing on actor-network theory. we show that due to a peculiar entanglement of the products of present as well as past policies - staff planning charts. curricular norm values. student numbers. block grants. etc. - in several cases administration defines teaching loads higher than the actual teaching staff at faculty level can provide. In order to close this gap. faculties have to accommodate a teaching load that is true to administrative calculations but fictional in reality. Paradoxically. the only way to do so within the given policy entanglement is to use academics for teaching on the premise that they explicitly do not count as teachers: they have to remain disconnected from the teaching faculty.

464,Faculty participation in mentoring undergraduate research can be limited by the time demands involved and the relatively low compensation typically offered at most institutions. The system designed by Chapman University's Office of Undergraduate Research and Creative Activity (OURCA) facilitates independent research by undergraduate students who wish to receive academic credit and awards teaching credit to faculty members who mentor this research. This faculty-student research banking (FSRB) program counts student research credits toward faculty teaching loads. allowing 24 credits to be exchanged for a one-course reduced teaching load in a future academic term. The financial and structural parameters of the FSRB program and data from the first three years of its operation are provided. including guidelines developed and lessons learned. which may assist other institutions in applying and creating similar systems.

465,Achieving the Saudi Kingdom?s vision 2030 in the higher education sector requires higher education institutions to make a significant simultaneous change in their current practices. This encompasses the transitioning of government-funded educational institutions to be financially independent. Therefore. a prompt. agile transition is required while maintaining a positive socioeconomic impact. entrepreneurship and innovation. and high-quality education. This necessitates the transition to lean processes and the review of current practices. One of the most vital processes in educational institutions is student admission/enrollment capacity planning. This study puts forward a capacity planning decision support system (DSS)-based framework for university student enrollment. The framework was applied to the case of KAU. where current practice and challenges are presented. and from which data were collected. A top-down/bottom-up approach was followed and applied using the goal programming technique and a developed mathematical model. respectively. Results show that the proposed framework effectively affects student admission/enrollment capacity planning on strategic and operational levels. Moreover. it can be used in other planning aspects of higher education in universities. such as human resources planning. teaching load planning. faculty-to-student ratios. accreditation. quality requirements. lab capacity planning. equipment/teaching aids procurement. and financial planning. to mention a few. The implications of this study include assisting decision-makers in higher education institutions in matching their admission/enrollment capacity of student numbers between the macro-strategic and the micro-operational level.   2022 by the authors.

467,Distributed systems programming (DSP) is an important subject in the Computer Engineering undergraduate degree. The use of a version of the SIMCAM simulator adapted to the educational context enabled our DSP students to exercise important facets of DSP that are otherwise difficult or impossible to incorporate in student activities. Analyzing and quantifying the assumed benefits of this educational intervention on student learning enables us to better adapt such interventions to student needs. To investigate the impact on student learning of this novel use of a simulator we analyze both the course-assessment results and the constructors of the technology acceptance model. the latter via an initial survey of student perceptions carried out at the beginning of the course and another carried out after completing the simulator-based assignment. We observe. in particular. an improvement in the overall grades between the target year and those of the year previous to the simulator introduction. Moreover. other statistical findings are also of interest.   2019 Wiley Periodicals. Inc.

476,This position paper describes the legal framework requirements when crediting digital teaching formats towards the teaching load in higher education medical teaching. as exemplified by the Federal State of Bavaria in Germany. It reveals the need for precise rules adapted to the advances in technology. if the process of digitalisation in higher education (HE) is not to come to a halt.If HE institutions are to act as centres of innovation with respect to the implementation of digital teaching and learning formats. then structural and strategic positioning with regard to e- and blended learning above all is called for in addition to financial resources. as well as the distribution and sustainable incorporation of digital offerings in faculties and HE institutions. There is a great deal of insecurity however with respect to the legal framework requirements and how best to count digital teaching towards ones own teaching load. This results to some extent from the complexity of current laws and regulations partially overtaken by didactic and methodological changes in education. with decentralised educational federalism only adding to the complexity. Bearing in mind teaching and learning formats that are undergoing change or have already been transformed. ways of adapting the (legal) framework to the digital shift need to be found. last but not least in order to offer enthusiastic teaching staff incentives to develop and expand digital formats.

477,Research on factors that have an influence on scholars' success has a rather long tradition. but only recently has this research field become a hot topic in management research. which means that our knowledge of the determinants of success in business academia is fairly new and fragmented. The study presented in this paper contributes to this knowledge by empirically testing the influence of selected factors on research productivity of young business scholars working in Visegrad countries (the Czech Republic. Hungary. Poland. and Slovakia). The research productivity is defined and measured through scholars' publication scores. including publications in journals with JCR's Impact Factor (IF). The study suggests that among key determinants of the success of a business scholar from Visegrad area. there are English language skills and teaching load. Surprisingly. productivity of young business scholars seems not to be leveraged much by the recognizability of their supervisors. Moreover. contrary to some other studies. teaching load correlates positively with research productivity.

The article is devoted to the analysis of legislation on personal data and it's enforcement in the educational process in higher educational institutions.The purpose of the article is highlight controversies in legislation on personal data. generating mistakes in enforcement during the educational procedures.The description of methodology. The author uses methods of complex analysis. synthesis. as well as formal-logical and formal-legal methods.The main results and scope of their application. The practice of interpreting the concepts of ""personal data"". ""confidential personal data"". ""official secret"". ""publicly available personal data"" is extremely contradictory.Currently. there are hundreds departmental regulatory legal acts about various aspects of the protection of official secrets. Analysis of these acts shows that the rules aimed at preserving the confidentiality of official information regulate the following aspects of the functioning of state and municipal bodies. institutions and organizations: (a) ensuring access to official information, (b) providing state and municipal services, (c) document flow and record keeping, (d) staffing, (e) anti-corruption, (f) use of information systems, (g) interaction with the media, (h) prevention of conflicts of interest.The study load cannot be attributed to the personal data. that requires the consent of the teacher to be processed. The study load is nothing more than publicly available information. arising from the principles of collegiality of educational process management. competitiveness of education. its openness and transparency. that are established in the legislation on education.Conclusions. Extended interpretation of confidential personal data and inclusion of the teaching load to it is unacceptable. This contributes to conflicts of interest. corrupt factors and devaluation of higher education. PU  - DOSTOEVSKY OMSK STATE UNIV PI  - OMSK PA  - PROSPEKT MIRA 55-A. OMSK. 644077. RUSSIA"
481,"The ""Degree in Chemistry"" program at the University of Alicante-UA- entails a great teaching load aimed at industrial work opportunities as well as research. development and innovation. However. it clearly lacks a didactic and pedagogical training. which obliges those students who desire a teaching professional future to develop the necessary pedagogical skills through a Master's Degree. Other universities. like the National University of Rosario-UNR-(Argentina). proposes two clearly different degrees on chemistry formation in order to meet the future professional prospects of both. those who prefer to be engaged in industry or innovation-research. and those who aim to become chemistry educators.In view of the UNR ""Chemistry Degree"" and ""Chemistry Teaching Degree"" academic plans. the authors propose an adaptation of the aforementioned programs to the ""Degree in Chemistry"" taught by the UA. The present work describes a new and unique studying plan which includes two alternative stands depending on the job orientation desired by the student: i) pedagogical strand, and ii) disciplinary strand. For a training oriented to industry. research and development. the current curriculum of the University of Alicante would be maintained. but would also include some pedagogical subjects. In this way. the student would be prepared to face a professional work position where the transmission of knowledge could also be necessary. On the contrary. the student could access a teaching-oriented training according to a curriculum that combines the subjects of disciplinary training (common to the path of industrial orientation) and an important teaching load of pedagogy. This multidisciplinary aspects studied in the degree. allows to perform a professor to teach for all the educational chemistry levels.

483,"This paper considers the relationship between assessment method and teaching method and shows that alignment of assessment and teaching methods provides opportunities for significant increase in graduate quality and simultaneous decrease in teaching load and resource costs. The paper is based on both formal reviews of programmes in a range of disciplines including architecture. engineering. law. medicine and science. in universities in Australia. Europe and North America. and collaborative research involving linear and cross-sectional studies of teachers. programmes and successive cohorts of students in those disciplines. These reviews and research have shown that institutional reforms including new teaching methods intended to achieve greater relevance and student satisfaction. new assessment methods intended to meet accreditation and quality assurance requirements. and organisational restructuring of faculties intended to achieve ""efficiencies"". have all failed to achieve sustainable benefit. Worse. in many cases these interventions have been counterproductive and have resulted in ""quality failure"" and teacher. resource and student overload. The paper also shows that. if the assessment and teaching methods are not aligned to precisely the same expected outcomes. then the very best teaching methods are rendered ineffective. wasteful of teachers' skills and efforts. and expensive. Various outcome factors contribute to this effect. including types of knowledge and skills involved. engagement of various student thinking and learning patterns. and intended attitude and value systems. The paper shows that alignment of the teaching and assessment methods to precisely the same outcome factors provides opportunities for significant improvement in both student satisfaction and quality of graduates. and opportunities for significant reduction in teaching and resource load.

485,Previous research studies have indicated the positive impact that doing research has upon teachers' teaching pedagogies and professional growth. However. only a few studies concerning the challenges and benefits of doing research have been conducted in the Philippines and the ASEAN region. This study explores the experiences of Philippine public school teachers in conducting a school or a classroom research project. The data were collected through individual interviews administered to 11 public high school English teachers in Mindanao. Philippines. Findings suggest that although teachers' motivations to do research were more personal rather than professional. teachers recognised some benefits of doing school and classroom-based research for their teaching practices and career development. Challenges that were reported include the lack of financial support. heavy teaching load. lack of research skills and knowledge. and lack of research materials and resources. Implications are discussed in light of the findings and recommendations formulated for future research directions.

486,The concept of Task World Reality (TWR) for a sensor-based robot system and human operator at the worksite is proposed. Based on the TWR concept. a Multimodal Teaching Advisor (MTA) which utilizes the work-site human operator's know-how and sensory information in a complementary manner has been developed. This system integrates task specifications. system constraints including their tolerances. sensing information. and operator- and robot-related information. MTA provides both graphical and audio user interfaces using a spatial human tracker in Order to support an advanced teaching environment for a work-site operator. A complicated spatial path tracking task is taken as a typical case study. Experimental results show that not only the human operator's teaching load but also the task quality are greatly improved by MTA. PU  - IEEE PI  - NEW YORK PA  - 345 E 47TH ST. NEW YORK.

487,With the popularity of embedded systems and the consequently rising demand in the job market for professionals well-versed in them. embedded operating systems (EOSs) have become one of the core courses in computer science studies across the world. The objective of EOS courses is to develop students' ability to port. modify. and customize an embedded operating system through a series of laboratory exercises. However. our teaching experience has revealed that beginners require a considerable amount of time to familiarize themselves with the development environment and the relevant processes. such as operating in a command line interface. setting environment variables. and kernel configurations. Furthermore. students need to constantly handle compiler error messages. malfunctions of the target EOS. and incompatibility issues related to development tools. These problems may frustrate and discourage students. A common strategy to address this problem is to dedicate more hours to teaching or to hire more teaching assistants to help students progress. However. none of these methods is suitable for institutions with limited resources. Therefore. in this paper. we develop a computer-assisted learning system called the Computer-assisted Learning Environment (CALEE) to assist students with their assignments and thus motivate them. CALEE consists of two parts: a self-learning assistant (SLAT) and a collaborative learning website (CLW). SLAT is a software application that provides a set of useful functions to help students perform EOS laboratory exercises. whereas the collaborative learning website seeks to encourage greater interaction among students. Our experiments show that CALEE expedites learning. improves students' motivation. and reduces the teaching load. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

488,"The article touches upon the changes in roles within the academic profession in Russia arising from the education and science reform. The analysis is made through the example of the National Research University Higher School of Economics (HSE). Both quantitative and qualitative data is used to suggest a typology of faculties based on their work time allocation. The typology includes five types of faculties: teacher researchers. teachers. researchers. ""universal soldiers"". and experts. Each type displays different levels of satisfaction with their work time budget: those who do a lot of teaching and administrative work tend to be less satisfied. This can be explained by the changes in the system of faculty certification in Russia and by how academic staff respond to those changes. Interview results are used to highlight the typical work time allocation problems faced by faculties. These include a low degree of freedom to manage one's own work time. the lack of boundary in work-life balance. excessive teaching load. an increase in unscheduled tasks. and the problem of delegating workloads which require high research and management skills.

489,Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the level of workload among pharmacy academicians working in public and private sector universities in India. The study also aimed to assess the satisfaction of academicians towards their workload.Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted for a period of 2 months among pharmacy academicians in Karnataka state of Southern India. Convenience sampling was used to select a sample and was contacted via email and/or social networking sites. Questionnaire designed by thorough review literature was used as a tool to collect data on workload (teaching. research. extracurricular services) and satisfaction.Results: Of 214 participants. 95 returned the filled questionnaire giving the response rate of 44.39{\%}. Private sector academicians had more load of teaching (p=0.046) and they appeared to be less involved in research activities (p=0.046) as compared to public sector academicians. More than half of the respondents (57.9{\%}) were satisfied with their workload with Assistant Professors were least satisfied as compared to Professors (p= 0.01).Conclusion: Overall. private sector academicians are more burdened by teaching load and also are less satisfied of their workload. Revision of private universities policies may aid in addressing this issue. PU  - PREMCHAND SHANTIDEVI RESEARCH FOUNDATION PI  - DELHI PA  - 71 JAIN COLONY. VEER NAGAR. DELHI. 110 007. INDIA
490,The paper presents a computer program designated for teaching load modelling fundamentals. answering an increasing need for education of electrical engineers in this area. The program is based on data obtained during numerous field tests that encompass voltage changes using on-load tap changers. In this way students apply a measurement-based load modelling approach and analyse load behaviour from many practical examples during voltage changes on different days of the week and over different time periods. The program allows future engineers to become familiar with some important fundamental issues of load modelling such as: identification of load model parameters. selection of proper load model. determination of representative load characteristics and adequacy of the usage of an approximate load model.

494,"Research is vital and necessary part of modern university education, universities are producers of new knowledge. Research publications are necessarily required for academic employment and promotion. Role of universities is diverse from the 19th century, demands of the 21st century are enormously higher. Presently government looks ahead to the universities to become more and more proficient and effectual in teaching and research. On the other hand there appear to be many factors. hindrances and obstacles to conduct research. The purpose of study was to investigate the factors related to research productivity at University level. which factors influence university teachers to conduct research and to find out the causes of high and low research productivity at university level. Population of the study was faculty members working at University. Sample consisting of 232 male and female faculty members was selected through the stratified sampling technique. Quantitative research methodology was adopted, data was collected through questionnaire. Data collected through the questionnaire was analyzed by using the statistical methods and SPSS. To describe the data at the initial stage percentages were calculated. At the second stage mean score. SD and Chi-Square. the test of significance was applied. The level of significance selected for the study was 0.05. On the basis of findings. the conclusions were drawn that extra teaching load. performance of administrative duties along with academic duties. lack of funds nonexistence of research leave. negative attitude of the faculty towards research. lack of research skills. non availability of latest books. absence of professional journals. less number of university own journals. are the major causes of low productivity and reduced the research productivity of the IIUI faculty members. Faculty members are satisfied with the computer and internet facility provided to them by the university. however. they wants more research grants/funds. availability of latest books {\&} journals. arrangement of research conferences and seminars. According to the findings of the study faculty members want escape from administrative duties. they want more incentives and rewards. establishment of departmental libraries. and desire to have exposure to foreign universities. Faculty members should given less teaching load. smooth and progressive environment is necessary for higher research productivity. Faculty members are required to acquire knowledge of Statistics, they must develop research skills and need to manage their time to enhance their number of research publications. Positive attitude and excellent interpersonal relations of the faculty members causes high productivity. Faculty members are required to share ideas and research work among each other to enhance their research out put. Faculty members having good number of publications can motivate and guide their colleagues who have no publications. University management is necessarily required to collaborate with renowned universities and research organizations. Heads of the departments and Deans of the faculties must issue appreciation letters to the faculty members who published in recognized journals or present their papers at conference proceedings.

495,Objectives: To identify the prevalence. factors and obstacles affecting research productivity among academic staff at medical and health colleges in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.Methods: This cross-sectional survey employed self-administered questionnaires to collect data on faculty members' profile. research activities. and obstacles impeding research productivity. The questionnaires were distributed randomly to 500 faculty members. of which 389 (77.8{\%}) completed the questionnaire at 10 medical and health colleges during January to April 2011. The data were analyzed and presented in a descriptive fashion.Results: Only 150 (38.6{\%}) respondents reported published work in the past 2 years. Of these. 80{\%} indicated sole-authors research and around a quarter (26{\%}) reported co-authors work. Males and young faculty members were more likely to publish research than their counterparts. Faculty members who reported involvement in administrative activities were less likely to publish. Those who reported supervising postgraduate students or had attained training on research methods were more likely to produce research. Respondents perceived that lack of time. lack of research assistants. lack of funds for research. and being busy with teaching load were the most cited obstacles impeding research productivity.Conclusion: Understanding factors and barriers impeding research productivity is a prerequisite for interventions that are directed to promote health services research among faculty members in medical schools.

496,The impact of higher education reforms on teaching at faculty level in Germany has seldom been explored. Research on teaching at university so far centres on how to teach. Yet. before any (best) practice can take place. teaching requires a specific site where a specific teacher meets a specific number of students. To bring about teaching. teaching loads have to be matched with student numbers. which to a large degree depends on how existing policies interact. Drawing on actor-network theory. we show that due to a peculiar entanglement of the products of present as well as past policies - staff planning charts. curricular norm values. student numbers. block grants. etc. - in several cases administration defines teaching loads higher than the actual teaching staff at faculty level can provide. In order to close this gap. faculties have to accommodate a teaching load that is true to administrative calculations but fictional in reality. Paradoxically. the only way to do so within the given policy entanglement is to use academics for teaching on the premise that they explicitly do not count as teachers: they have to remain disconnected from the teaching faculty.

497,Objective: To pilot-test feasibility. acceptance and learning-outcomes of a brief interdisciplinary communication skills training program in undergraduate medical education.Methods: A two-hour interdisciplinary communication skills program with simulated patients was developed and pilot-tested with clinical students at Hamburg University. Five psychosocial specialties facilitated the training. Composite effects were measured qualitatively and quantitatively.Results: Eighty students volunteered to participate in the pilot-program (intervention-group). Their evaluations of the program were very positive (1.1 on a six-point scale). Benefits were seen in feedback. increase of self-confidence. cross-disciplinary clinical and communication experience. Students who did not volunteer (n = 206) served as the control-group. The intervention-group performed significantly better (p = 0.023) in a primary care communication examination and female students performed better than males. Clinical teachers evaluated the pilot-training very positively with regard to learning-outcomes and feasibility. The positive results from the pilot-training led to implementation into the regular curriculum.Conclusions: A two-hour interdisciplinary communication skills training program is beneficial for medical students with regard to communication competencies. self-confidence and learning-outcomes.Practice implication: The training is feasible within given time-frames and limited staff resources. The high teaching load for small-group-training are split between five specialties. The concept might be an interesting option for other faculties. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

498,Hospital efficiency is an important dimension for health services evaluation and suffers the influence of different non-discretionary variables. not necessarily under the control of the hospital manager. These must be considered when establishing goals for efficient and socially committed health. which in many countries is now the primary goal. To test and further understand the context of non-controllable variables in healthcare delivery. this study examined 104 teaching hospitals in Brazil. The efficiency score was generated using weight restricted-output oriented data envelopment analysis model. A second-stage logistic regression analysis was deployed to examine the predictors of efficiency among the non-discretionary variables. The efficiency results indicate that. it requires reduction in labor and in bed capacity. while it increases necessary admissions and high complexity procedures. The main predictors of efficiency were the size of the hospital. high teaching intensity. and low teaching dedication. The model predicts no association between efficiency and ownership. Teaching load. as an important source of qualified human resources to society. although associated with higher health costs. when not considered in service delivery. may distort the analysis of efficiency for the teaching hospitals. These findings could have implications for any healthcare system that has teaching hospitals among its components. PU  - ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS.

499,Using a theory of affordances. this study examines the introduction of e-books into the early literacy environment as resources that can increase children's opportunity for learning vocabulary. Added value was observed under conditions of (1) book browsing. (2) instruction. and (3) a print-only condition. A total of 33 4-year-olds (18 boys. 15 girls) from nine Head Start classrooms assigned to one of the three conditions participated over an 8-week period. Mean differences in target words learned in total and by mode in each condition were statistically significant in favor of the e-book-enriched environments. Differences in word learning between e-book environment conditions were clinically significant. Mean differences in words learned by total and by mode for children with varying levels of vocabulary knowledge (low. average. high) showed that those in e-book-enriched classrooms learned about 25{\%} of the target words with children with low vocabulary showing comparable gains. Results suggest added value of e-books in the early literacy environment: (1) affording children more exposure to target words to their advantage. (2) creating a choice of reading material in the early literacy environment. and (3) providing built-in scaffolds (e.g.. hotspots) that may carry some of the teaching load of vocabulary instruction.

500,"Teacher education research in Turkey can be categorized under five headings: attitudes and perceptions of teacher candidates toward teaching, competency perceptions of teacher candidates, school experience, assessment of teacher education programs, and the impact of teacher education research on teacher candidates' knowledge. skills and attitudes. Research on attitudes and perceptions of teaching is carried out mostly through surveys. whereas quantitative. qualitative and mixed designs are used in studying teacher education programs and school experience. The relations between teacher education process and the knowledge. skills and attitudes of teacher candidates are explored through experimental. correlational and qualitative designs. Most of these research studies focus on descriptive aspects of teacher education rather than exploring relations among teacher education and teacher performance in schools. There are several reasons for narrow scope of teacher education research: First. there is no agreement on the terms used in the field of teacher education. Second. teacher education programs are determined by the Higher Education Council. Third. the research is mostly geared toward the students and instructors at the faculties of education rather than teachers in schools. Fourth. the teaching load of the instructors at faculties of education is heavy. thereby not leaving much time for research. Finally. there is not much meta-analysis on teacher education research to reflect what has been learned and to give new directions to the researchers.

501,Mapping the competency of personnel with different level of expertise. skill set. and experience in professional fields is a tough. complex but essential task. In this work. we have considered an Engineering College with moderate number of faculties with different level of experience. expertise and research exposure. Here we have considered the load assignment to the faculties at the beginning of a semester as the competency mapping task. Each faculty having capabilities of teaching different subjects out of the total set of papers needs to take about two theory papers with or without laboratory component. The decisive factors for subject assignment may be depth of knowledge. sincerity. class management. contribution towards research. text book publication. Further preference of the faculty member should be considered with top priority unless there are some valid constraints. Again the teaching personnel in a department hold different designations and different administrative responsibility. therefore each of them cannot be assigned equal hours of teaching load. The decisive factors are considered as objectives to be optimized and multi-objective particle Swarm optimization (MOPSO) is employed to perform the competency mapping task. The simulation results show the effectiveness of this approach. PU  - IEEE PI  - NEW YORK PA  - 345 E 47TH ST. NEW YORK. NY 10017 USA
502,OBJECTIVES: Our primary objective was to describe the pulse oximetry discharge thresholds used by general and pediatric emergency physicians for well-appearing children with bronchiolitis and pneumonia. and to assess the related practice variability.METHODS: This mail-in survey was conducted in August and September 2001 and included the 281 active members of the Pediatric Emergency Medicine Section of the American College of Emergency Physicians. The survey consisted of 2 case scenarios of previously healthy. well-appearing children: a 2-year-old with pneumonia and a 10-month-old with bronchiolitis. Respondents were asked about their years of experience. teaching load. percentage of children in their practice. whether they currently have a written departmental guideline at their institution. and the lowest pulse oximetry reading that they would accept and still discharge the patient directly home.RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-two (65{\%}) physicians answered the survey and met the inclusion criteria. The respondents' median oximetry value and interquartile range (IQR) for the pneumonia and bronchiolitis cases were 93{\%} (92{\%}-94{\%}) and 94{\%} (92{\%}-94{\%}) respectively. With the exception of the 3 physicians practising {\textgreater}1000 metres above sea level. the responses by subgroups were similar.CONCLUSIONS: There does not yet exist a safe. clinically validated pulse oximetry discharge threshold. Emergency physicians from this study sample have a modest degree of practice variability in a self-reported pulse oximetry discharge threshold. Emergency physicians may use this data to compare their own practice with that reported by this group.

504,BackgroundWith the rise in graduate unemployment and the poor linkage between university education and industry. competency-based training (CBT) is gaining popularity in Ghana's universities as a way of producing business-oriented and well-grounded graduates for industry who are ready to make use of knowledge acquired in university education to establish businesses that will help reduce unemployment in the country as well as working effectively in the nation's industry and service sectors. With CBT yet to be introduced in most Ghanaian tertiary institutions. information about academics' perception and willingness to adopt the methodology is crucial. This study examined the perception and adoption of CBT by academics in Ghana using cross-sectional data collected from 300 faculty members of Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST) using a structured questionnaire. Descriptive statistics. 5-point Likert scale. perception index. and the logit model were the methods of analysis employed.ResultsThe results of the survey showed that the overall perception index was 0.49. indicating that generally faculty members of KNUST agreed and had a positive perception of the potential of CBT in instilling in students employable skills. The logit results also showed that the probability of adoption of CBT is positively influenced by participation in CBT workshops. effective supervision of faculty members by university authorities. availability of teaching aids. and availability of incentives. Conversely. adoption was found to be negatively influenced by teaching load and number of undergraduate students per class.ConclusionsWe conclude that provision of appropriate teaching and learning resources that complement adoption of CBT. incentives. and competency-based education training for academics by university authorities and stakeholders in Ghana's tertiary education will enhance the adoption of CBT methodologies.

506,Background. All UK medical schools are revising their curricula following the General Medical Council recommendations to increase general practice involvement in undergraduate education. However. workload in general practice has increased in recent years. raising questions about its ability to maintain. let alone extend. its educational activities.Aim. The aim of this study was examine whether recent changes in general practice have affected delivery of practice-based undergraduate education and to assess the extent to which practices will be able to increase their involvement in teaching.Method. A postal questionnaire survey was conducted of the lead clinical teachers and their partners in the practices to which students from Leicester Medical School had been attached in the last 2 years.Results. The questionnaire was completed by 32 out of the 39 lead teachers and 134 of the 150 partners. an overall response rate of 88{\%}. There was widespread support for departmental teaching requirements. but only 17 lead teachers (44{\%}) felt that the suggested reduction by 25{\%} of patients seen per session while teaching was feasible. A total of 14 lead teachers (47{\%}) felt that the ability of their practice to deliver high-quality teaching had declined since 1990. Altogether. 113 (87{\%}) of all doctors in teaching practices felt that rime pressures had increased during this period. and 139 (88{\%}) felt that present levels of remuneration were inadequate. The majority of these doctors felt that general practice was the preferred location for learning generic clinical skills and were interested in participating. Nevertheless. most were not prepared to increase their involvement in teaching under present arrangements.Conclusion. Practice-based teachers appreciate the need for quality teaching. remain enthusiastic about teaching and are. in principle. willing to take an increased teaching load. However. recent changes have made delivery of teaching more difficult. and if an expansion in practice-based teaching is to occur. more realistic levels of funding and support are a prerequisite.

It had been a year of contentious meetings. followed by passionate e-mail salvos with bold highlights for emphasis.

508,"Newly-emergent universities face a plethora of problems which bedevil development efforts and inhibit the building of a research culture almost from scratch. These challenges arise from lack of human and material resources. lack of research infrastructure. lack of role models and mentors and general capacity problems often lumped together and described as a general lack of a ""research culture."" In order to redress this lack of a research culture and encourage the building of an active research enterprise. the 10-year old University of Technology. Jamaica introduced a seed grant mechanism in 1998. since re-designated the Research Development Fund (RDF) to encourage staff of the university to pursue research activity. Despite this initiative. response to the funding has been lackluster. In this paper. we investigate the reasons why academic staff at the University have not utilized this promising facility and what could be done to encourage more active participation in research.Out of the 66 academic staff who responded to a questionnaire survey. 74.2{\%} claimed to be aware of the available funding for research in the university but only 10.6{\%} had applied for funding under the RDF mechanism between 1999 and 2004. Of those who applied. only half were successful. However. about a third of the respondents have been utilizing other funds for research outside of the RDF. The reasons given for not applying for the fund include lack of time to write the proposal or conduct the study (46.9{\%}). the bureaucracy surrounding the release of the fund (22.8{\%}). the paucity of information in the proposal form and the tedious application process (19.6{\%}) while 7.5{\%} of the respondents were deterred by fear of being rejected. However. such reasons may just underlie the need for more capacity building efforts. research training and mentorship at all levels. A number of suggestions were made by the respondents in order to encourage increased participation in the application process. These include a more customer-friendly application process. reduction in teaching load in favor of research. research mentorship and the reduction in staff participation at meetings and other administrative duties.

Surveys show that students value the intensive clinical teaching. smaller student numbers and perceived greater friendliness in DGHs. This paper explores DGH staff attitudes to teaching - their level of initial enthusiasm. their attitudes to current teaching. its effect on the hospital and to the sustainability of DGH undergraduate teaching - as both student numbers and service workloads continue to rise.Methods Semi-structured interviews with 6 key informants were used to generate themes for a 19-question pre-piloted anonymous postal questionnaire sent to all 68 staff involved in undergraduate medical teaching in Northampton General Hospital.Results The total response included 85{\%} of consultants. Responses in the 3 staff groups were similar. Most respondents felt enthusiastic at the prospect of medical students. although they realised that this would be intellectually challenging and increase time pressures. These predictions were largely fulfilled. Respondents felt that in comparison to teaching hospitals the DGH teaching was more clinically based and consultant-led. with more approachable staff. Currently 41 respondents (82{\%}) felt that they had inadequate teaching time. A majority felt that the arrival of students had improved patient care and that their department had benefited. Thirty-seven responders (74{\%}) felt that the planned doubling of student numbers would impose an unsustainable departmental load. and would compromise teaching quality. The change felt most necessary to support additional teaching was increased clinical medical staff. Better co-ordination between the DGH and the medical school was also felt necessary. The most popular choice for the distribution of extra teaching finance was to the teacher's directorate. i.e. speciality [33 (66{\%})]. Forty-four (86{\%}) felt that increased student numbers would have a significant impact on the character of the hospital. The 108 free-text comments (2.1 per respondent) centred on hospital character and the benefits of students.Conclusions This study shows a considerable initial enthusiasm for teaching in DGH staff. which is persisting despite increasing student numbers. However. the current teaching load is seen to be substantial. Teaching more students is likely to produce major problems. based on lack of teaching time and increasingly heavy service commitments rather than lack of patients. This is likely to be a widespread problem for DGHs. Failure to ensure adequate teaching staff and facilities as well as co-ordination could threaten the sustainability of this potentially valuable teaching initiative.

510,The purpose of this study was to make a case study of instructional consulting geared toward beginning elementary school teachers in the field of social studies. It? specifically meant to examine the awareness of beginning elementary school teachers about social studies instruction and their difficulties by having an in-depth interview. and a consulting model for social studies class was developed and applied in an effort to overcome the limits of existing instructional supervision. Instructional consulting is still in the rudimentary stage. and only the concept of it has been defined. That isn? yet prevailing. and there are no obvious guidelines about its procedure. either. The meaning of instructional consulting was discussed in this study. and an instructional consulting model tailored to the needs of beginning teachers was developed and applied instead of merely sticking with existing instructional supervision practices. And whether the model brought any changes to the social studies instruction of beginning teachers was checked.The selected beginning teachers. who had been learners in the past and then turned into teachers. faced lots of pressure due to the diversity of social studies. teaching load and the necessity of localization and individualization. and they also had difficulties in understanding the curriculum. instructional models and teaching methods and in preparing materials. There wasn? sufficient information on how to tide over the difficulties. and they found it difficult to seek a solution. Instructional consulting was provided for the beginning teachers to boost their instructional professionalism in social studies. and the instructional consulting that involved prior interview. preliminary diagnosis. instructional observation. instructional planning. instructional analysis. evaluation and feedback enabled the teachers to have a good understanding of the social studies curriculum and to formulate strategies about how to proceed with social studies class. At the same time. that made a contribution to the rearrangement of the social studies curriculum. the utilization of diverse instructional strategies. the diversity of evaluation and the improvement of teacher professionalism. and that ultimately made it possible to give a quality instruction. which could be called a good case.

511,In spite of the growth of Israel's population. the number of graduates from the four Israeli Schools of Medicine has changed very little in the last 30 years. Nevertheless. the annual number of new practitioners grew from about 300 to 900. due to Israeli graduates of European Schools and the large number of physicians among the new immigrants from the former USSR states in the early nineties. A committee. nominated by the National Board of Higher Education (MALAG). headed by the late Prof. Pazi. concluded that under steady state conditions we must train 800 medical students per year. MALAG adopted this recommendation. As a first step. MALAG approved two new programs: a special program for Academic Reserve candidates (Atudaim) and a new (5th) medical school in the Galilee. These two new programs. together with the new 4-year MD program in Tel Aviv. will add about 200 graduates to the list of medical students. Yet. the question of whether we can realize the recommendation of Pazi's Committee (to train 800 MDs annually) and at what cost. remains open. This preliminary review is devoted to the relevant factors that must be considered before the latter questions can be answered. First. we note that the limiting factor of the number of medical students is the ratio between the number of teaching departments in each of the medical disciplines and the number of weeks of Clerkships required in the given disciplines. Our main conclusion is that realization of the recommendation of Pazi's committee requires an increase in the number of teaching departments. preferably by upgrading the academic level of those departments that do not teach students. and increasing the teaching load of other departments. We may also have to reduce the number of weeks of 'bedside teaching' but should beware of reducing it to a minimum lower than about 70 weeks. as in North America. Regardless of the need to train more physicians. we must increase teaching in the community. Only a combination of all these measures will reduce our dependence on the education of Israeli physicians abroad.
512,The opening of a new medical school is a cause for celebration. Starting with a clean slate often gives the opportunity to adopt more modern teaching practices. However. encouraging large numbers of clinicians to start teaching and to adopt these new methods brings its own set of challenges.During the expansion phase of a new medical school. it was often noted that new teachers seemed to have considerable difficulties. and often expressed these as negativity towards student placements. This did not chime with much of the work from established schools. which seemed to evaluate expansion of teaching more positively. We wanted to better understand the issues involved.Semi-structured interviews were conducted involving GPs who had received medical students over the first four years of a newly established medical school. The aims were to assess the impact of the students on the new teachers. and to try to better understand why some teachers were experiencing difficulties. We collected qualitative and quantitative data at the interviews. The qualitative data were analysed using grounded theory which aims to link emerging themes together.The findings suggest that as the quantity of teaching medical students increases. the enjoyment and commitment to teaching may decrease. Concerns over the administration of teaching may begin to predominate. Two factors may help to reduce this:1 Adequate investment in manpower and premises to reduce time and space constraints on teaching.2 Practices considering themselves as teaching practices where education is a part of the practice identity.

513,"Examining mathematics performance in the PISA 2003 survey in Iceland reveals that higher performance was reached in large schools than in small schools (Kristin Bjarnadottir. 2008). This was also the case in Denmark (Egelund. 2006). Mathematics was again in the focus of PISA 2012. in which most 15-year old students in Iceland participated. When the test results were revealed in December 2013. the Icelandic testing institute was asked to divide the schools into four categories: 1-10. 11-25. 26-40 and 41-128 participating students. The numbers of schools were 36. 39. 34 and 25 respectively. The corresponding numbers of students were 192. 658. 1122 and 1537 (see Tafla 1). The results in the category of largest number of students participating in PISA 2012 were again significantly better than in other school-sizes. 504 points on average against 493 points in Iceland as a whole. and only 481 points on average in schools of 11-25 participants (see Mynd 3. Mynd 4 and Tafla 4).A questionnaire was sent to mathematics teachers in 10 schools in each of the three categories with the largest number of participants. leaving out the smallest schools. as individual school results in that category were not available from PISA 2003. A total of 63 responses were collected by telephone interviews with 25 teachers in 10 schools with 41-128 participants, 21 teachers in 9 schools with 26-40 participants, and 17 teachers in 10 schools with 11-25 participants. The corresponding numbers of participants in the chosen schools were 721. 303 and 174 respectively (see Tafla 1).The questions asked of the teachers concerned their education, their experience as mathematics teachers, their experience in teaching the group participating in PISA 2012, the proportion of mathematics teaching in their teaching assignments at the time of the survey and earlier, the textbooks they used for the PISA 2012 participants, and finally they were asked if the first upper secondary school mathematics course was an option for their students.The results did not reveal much difference in the teachers' educational background. Teachers in all categories had diverse backgrounds, the average age in each category was 48. 50 and 42 years respectively (see Tafla 3). and the majority had specialized in mathematics education through different kinds of work or degrees (see Tafla 5).Nearly all teachers in the school-group with 41-128 participants had taught the PISA 2012 participants during the academic year in question. the preceding year and many also two years earlier. but not always the same students (see Tafla 6). Thus they were closely familiar with the students as well as the teaching material that led up to PISA 2012. Many of them taught multiple sections of the same class. They therefore had more opportunities to reflect upon their teaching and reconsider their methods during the repetition than other teachers. Teachers in schools with 11-25 participating students were clearly less experienced in this area.The majority of schools in all categories could offer their students opportunities to take the first upper secondary school mathematics course (see Tafla 9). According to Shulman's (1986) theories. teachers' curriculum knowledge is important. in particular familiarity with the topics and issues that have been and will be taught in the same subject area during the preceding and later years in school. and the materials that embody them. No significant difference in the use of the two textbook series available was detected (see Tafla 10).Tafla 7 informs that the proportion of mathematics in the teaching load is highest among teachers in the largest schools. which supports Egelund's (2006) hypothesis that teachers in the largest schools have the greatest opportunities to teach the subject they are best prepared for. Furthermore. one may agree with Egelund's hypothesis that large schools offer the best possibilities of teachers' collaboration and team meetings concerning a subject are"
514,"What is known and objective The discussion about health equity in the United States frequently involves concerns over racial and ethnic minority under-representation in clinical trials and particularly in trials conducted in support of product approvals. The FDA has long worked to encourage diverse participation in clinical trials and through its Drug Trials Snapshots (DTS) program. the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has moved to make trial demographic data more accessible and transparent. We conducted a demographic study of U.S. participants in clinical trials for FDA-approved new drugs (new molecular entities [NMEs]. and original Biologics License Applications [BLAs]) from 2015 to 2019. as reported in DTS database with a purpose of understanding the extent to which U.S.-based trials used to support product approvals represent the racial and ethnic diversity of the U.S. population by therapeutic area. Methods Participant-level trial data were collected by accessing the FDA electronic common technical document (eCTD). for the applications used to publish each Snapshot. The therapeutic area (TA) for each drug was determined by review division assignment. The demographic data were analysed and compared to U.S. census data. Results and discussion We examined 102.596 U.S. participants in trials of new drugs that were approved and presented in Drug Trials Snapshots between 2015 and 2019. White participation ranged from 51{\%} in psychiatric trials to 90{\%} in cardiovascular (CV) trials, Black or African American participation ranged from 5{\%} in medical imaging to 45{\%} in psychiatric trials, Asian participation ranged from 0.75{\%} in CV to 4{\%} in dermatologic trials, and Hispanic or Latino participation ranged from 1{\%} in medical imaging to 22{\%} in infectious diseases and gastroenterology trials. What is new and conclusion Our data showed variable representation of racial and ethnic minorities across therapeutic areas at the U.S. sites. Blacks or African Americans were represented at or above U.S. census estimates across most therapeutic areas. while Asians and American Indian or Alaska Natives were consistently underrepresented. Hispanic or Latino participation across most therapeutic areas was below U.S. census estimates. however. more variable. and a sizable proportion of data was missing. The next step is a comparison of trial participation based on disease prevalence and epidemiology. which is a more accurate assessment of trial diversity.

515,"Purpose: The ability to identify the scholarship of individual authors is essential for performance evaluation. A number of factors hinder this endeavor. Common and similarly spelled surnames make it difficult to isolate the scholarship of individual authors indexed on large databases. Variations in name spelling of individual scholars further complicates matters. Common family names in scientific powerhouses like China make it problematic to distinguish between authors possessing ubiquitous and/or anglicized surnames (as well as the same or similar first names). The assignment of unique author identifiers provides a major step toward resolving these difficulties. We maintain. however. that in and of themselves. author identifiers are not sufficient to fully address the author uncertainty problem. In this study we build on the author identifier approach by considering commonalities in fielded data between authors containing the same surname and first initial of their first name. We illustrate our approach using three case studies.Design/methodology/approach: The approach we advance in this study is based on commonalities among fielded data in search results. We cast a broad initial net-i.e.. a Web of Science (WOS) search for a given author's last name. followed by a comma. followed by the first initial of his or her first name (e.g.. a search for 'John Doe' would assume the form: 'Doe. J'). Results for this search typically contain all of the scholarship legitimately belonging to this author in the given database (i.e.. all of his or her true positives). along with a large amount of noise. or scholarship not belonging to this author (i.e.. a large number of false positives). From this corpus we proceed to iteratively weed out false positives and retain true positives. Author identifiers provide a good starting point-e.g.. if 'Doe. J' and 'Doe. John' share the same author identifier. this would be sufficient for us to conclude these are one and the same individual. We find email addresses similarly adequate-e.g.. if two author names which share the same surname and same first initial have an email address in common. we conclude these authors are the same person. Author identifier and email address data is not always available. however. When this occurs. other fields are used to address the author uncertainty problem.Commonalities among author data other than unique identifiers and email addresses is less conclusive for name consolidation purposes. For example. if 'Doe. John' and 'Doe. J' have an affiliation in common. do we conclude that these names belong the same person? They may or may not, affiliations have employed two or more faculty members sharing the same last and first initial. Similarly. it's conceivable that two individuals with the same last name and first initial publish in the same journal. publish with the same co-authors. and/or cite the same references. Should we then ignore commonalities among these fields and conclude they're too imprecise for name consolidation purposes? It is our position that such commonalities are indeed valuable for addressing the author uncertainty problem. but more so when used in combination.Our approach makes use of automation as well as manual inspection. relying initially on author identifiers. then commonalities among fielded data other than author identifiers. and finally manual verification. To achieve name consolidation independent of author identifier matches. we have developed a procedure that is used with bibliometric software called VantagePoint (see www.thevantagepoint.com). While the application of our technique does not exclusively depend on VantagePoint. it is the software we find most efficient in this study. The script we developed to implement this procedure is designed to implement our name disambiguation procedure in a way that significantly reduces manual effort on the user's part. Those who seek to replicate our procedure independent of VantagePoint can do so by"
516,"BackgroundCapturing the scale of child maltreatment is difficult. but few would argue that it is anything less than a global problem which can affect victims' health and well-being throughout their life. Systems of detection. investigation and intervention for maltreated children are the subject of continued review and debate.ObjectivesTo assess the effectiveness of the formal use of family group decision-making (FGDM) in terms of child safety. permanence (of child's living situation). child and family well-being. and client satisfaction with the decision-making process.Search MethodsBoth published and unpublished manuscripts were considered eligible for this review. Library staff from Scholarly Information (Brownless Biomedical Library) University of Melbourne. conducted 14 systematic bibliographic searches. Reviewers also checked the reference lists of all relevant articles obtained. and reference lists from previously published reviews. Researchers also hand-searched 10 relevant journals.Selection CriteriaStudy samples of children and young people. aged 0-18 years. who have been the subject of a child maltreatment investigation. were eligible for this review. Studies had to have used random assignment to create treatment and control groups, or. parallel cohorts in which groups were assessed at the same point in time. Any form of FGDM. used in the course of a child maltreatment investigation or service. was considered an eligible intervention if it involved: a concerted effort to convene family. extended family. and community members, and professionals, and involved a planned meeting with the intention of working collaboratively to develop a plan for the safety well-being of children, with a focus on family-centred decision-making.Data Collection and AnalysisTwo review authors independently extracted the necessary data from each study report. using the software application Covidence. Covidence highlighted discrepancies between data extracted by separate reviewers. further analysis was conducted until a consensus was reached on what data were to be included in the review. Two authors also independently conducted analyses of study bias.Main ResultsEighteen eligible study reports were found. providing findings from 15 studies. involving 18 study samples. Four were randomised controlled trials (RCTs, N=941) the remainder employed quasi-experimental designs with parallel cohorts. Three of the quasi-experimental studies used prospective evaluations of nonrandomly assigned comparison groups (N=4.368), the rest analysed pre-existing survey data. child protection case files or court data (N=91.786). The total number of children studied was 97.095. The longest postintervention follow-up period was 3 years. Only four studies were conducted outside the United States, two in Canada and one in Sweden and one in the Netherlands. The review authors judged there to be a moderate or high risk of bias. in most of the bias categories considered. Only one study referenced a study protocol. Eleven of the fifteen studies were found to have a high likelihood of selection bias (73{\%}). Baseline imbalance bias was deemed to be unlikely in just two studies. and highly likely in nine (60{\%}). Confounding variables were judged to be highly likely in four studies (27{\%}). and contamination bias was judged highly likely in five studies (33{\%}). Researcher allegiance was rated as a high risk in three studies (20{\%}) where the authors argued for the benefits of FGDM within the article. but without supporting references to an appropriate evidence base. Bias from differential diagnostic activity. and funding source bias. were less evident across the evidence reviewed. This review combines findings for eight FGDM outcome measures. Findings from RCTs were available for four outcomes. but none of these. combined in meta-analysis or otherwise. were statistically significant. Combining findings from the quasi-experimental studies provided one statistically si"
517,"Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a rare. treatable antibody-mediated disease which is characterized by muscle weakness. The pathogenic antibodies are most frequently directed at the acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) at the skeletal muscle endplate. An ophthalmoplegic subphenotype of MG (OP-MG). which is characterized by treatment resistant weakness of the extraocular muscles (EOMs). occurs in a proportion of myasthenics with juvenile symptom onset and African genetic ancestry. Since the pathogenetic mechanism(s) underlying OP-MG is unknown. the aim of this study was to use a hypothesis-generating genome-wide analysis to identify candidate OP-MG susceptibility genes and pathways. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on 25 AChR-antibody positive myasthenic individuals of African genetic ancestry sampled from the phenotypic extremes: 15 with OP-MG and 10 individuals with control MG (EOM treatment-responsive). Variants were called according to the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) best practice guidelines using the hg38 reference genome. In addition to single variant association analysis. variants were mapped to genes (+/- 200 kb) using VEGAS2 to calculate gene-based test statistics and HLA allele group assignment was inferred through ""best-match"" alignment of reads against the IMGT/HLA database. While there were no single variant associations that reached genome-wide significance in this exploratory sample. several genes with significant gene-based test statistics and known to be expressed in skeletal muscle had biological functions which converge on muscle atrophy signaling and myosin II function. The closely linked HLA-DPA1 and HLA-DPB1 genes were associated with OP-MG subjects (gene-based p {\textless} 0.05) and the frequency of a functional A {\textgreater} G SNP (rs9277534) in the HLA-DPB1 3'UTR. which increases HLA-DPB1 expression. differed between the two groups (G-allele 0.30 in OP-MG vs. 0.60 in control MG, p = 0.04). Furthermore. we show that rs9277534 is an HLA-DBP1 expression quantitative trait locus in patient-derived myocytes (p {\textless} 1 x 10(-3)). The application of a SNP to gene to pathway approach to this exploratory WGS dataset of African myasthenic individuals. and comparing dichotomous subphenotypes. resulted in the identification of candidate genes and pathways that may contribute to OP-MG susceptibility. Overall. the hypotheses generated by this work remain to be verified by interrogating candidate gene and pathway expression in patient-derived extraocular muscle.

518,In May 2017. a cyber attack by ransomware called ransomware was confirmed worldwide. WarnerCry took a ransom in Microsoft software to get a ransom to encrypt a file and decrypt it. A total of more than 300.000 computers in over 150 countries were perceived as a threat to the reported cyber attacks. In addition to WarnerCry. cyber attacks are evolving and diversifying. and interest in cyber risk is increasing worldwide. As concerns about cyber risks spread. tightening regulations on privacy protection are also becoming a global trend. In Korea. the Personal Information Protection Act was fully enforced on September 29. 2011. In the United States. cybersecurity legislation is intensifying. and in May 2018. the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has been in effect in the EU.Increasing cyber attacks. increasing interest in cyber risks. and strengthening regulations are likely to lead to an increase in demand for cyber insurance. In the United States. public-private countermeasures against cyber risks occurred earlier than Korea. The use of cyber insurance is also underway. and some estimates that about 85{\%} of the global cyber insurance market (based on imported premiums) is at risk in the United States. This article looks at the most advanced US cyber insurance trends in the world.At this time. the cyber insurance market is expanding and changing. and a lot of information is coming out. In this situation. this paper summarizes the cyber insurance trends in the United States over the past year to serve as a reference for a wide range of insurers interested in cyber insurance. Also. the opinions and considerations in this article are my personal opinions and do not represent the organizations to which they belong. In the future. as development and use of IoT. autonomous vehicles. and drones are advanced. it is natural that companies and insurance companies face the threat of cyber risks becoming more and more complicated. Corporate expectations for cyber insurance are also expected to increase.In Europe and the UK. fewer companies have cyber insurance than the US. However. as the company's interest in data security increases due to the application of the GDPR in May 2018. cyber insurance coverage is expected to improve. For example. GDPR must report to regulatory authorities within 72 hours of a data breach. or to report data subjects such as customers. Corporate compliance risks will increase. and cyber insurance demand is likely to increase. However. if the cyber insurance provided by the insurer fails to meet the company's expectations in terms of future product content and premium rates. it may be possible to give some of the demand to the captive or insurance link securities (ILS).There will be an insurance companies need to meet corporate expectations more than ever by partnering with modeling firms and cyber security firms. and by closely accumulating data and risk models and using them to set product customers and rates. The cyber insurance market is still growing in the US and is expected to expand in Europe. As the market is a big change. we should keep an eye on the European movement. which is not covered in this article. PU  - The Korea Society for Legal Theory and Practice Inc.
519,Agroindustrial waste. such as fruit residues. are a renewable. abundant. low-cost. commonly-used carbon source. Biosurfactants are molecules of increasing interest due to their multifunctional properties. biodegradable nature and low toxicity. in comparison to synthetic surfactants. A better understanding of the associated microbial communities will aid prospecting for biosurfactant-producing microorganisms. In this study. six samples of fruit waste. from oranges. mangoes and mixed fruits. were subjected to autochthonous fermentation. so as to promote the growth of their associated microbiota. followed by short-read metagenomic sequencing. Using the DIAMOND+MEGAN analysis pipeline. taxonomic analysis shows that all six samples are dominated by Proteobacteria. in particular. a common core consisting of the genera Klebsiella. Enterobacter. Stenotrophomonas. Acinetobacter and Escherichia. Functional analysis indicates high similarity among samples and a significant number of reads map to genes that are involved in the biosynthesis of lipopeptide-class biosurfactants. Gene-centric analysis reveals Klebsiella as the main assignment for genes related to putisolvins biosynthesis. To simplify the interactive visualization and exploration of the surfactant-related genes in such samples. we have integrated the BiosurfDB classification into MEGAN and make this available. These results indicate that microbiota obtained from autochthonous fermentation have the genetic potential for biosynthesis of biosurfactants. suggesting that fruit wastes may provide a source of biosurfactant-producing microorganisms. with applications in the agricultural. chemical. food and pharmaceutical industries.

520,"Objectives: Public-private partnerships are a new way of thinking about promoting community health. which can lead to increased efficiency. equity. accountability. quality and accessibility throughout the health system. Resource constraints. high costs. and low quality of services have forced health officials and policymakers to reform. including the active participation of the private sector in the provision of primary health care. Therefore. considering the importance of the subject of this study. we aimed to determine the impediments and proponents of the implementation of public private participation in primary health care. Materials and methods: This descriptive study was conducted on a sample of 100 managers. policymakers. operational experts in the Ministry of Health. universities of medical sciences. health networks. and managers of private companies in the field of health services. It was done in 2020. Data were collected using a standard questionnaire on a 5-point Likert scale. to determine qualitative and qualitative content validity from the opinions of 10 professors and experts. and quantitative validity was determined with CVI. CVR = 0.95. and reliability of the questionnaire with Cronbach's alpha = 0.8. respectively. SPSS software version 21 was used for data analysis. Findings: The results of this study showed that the average health record of practitioners is 21 +/- 6.2 years. 80{\%} have a PhD. 90{\%} are in the public sector and 10{\%} are in the private sector. The average score of inhibitors of public private Participation -sector implementation is 93.18 and the average of the public-private Participation sector implementation factors is 53.62. Health managers view ""lack of capacity to define incentives and exemptions in health investment plans. lack of investor confidence in government technical and financial studies. lack of sustained funding to support the purchase of guaranteed primary health care and incorrect device managers"" Implementation of legal effects on project outsourcing and fear of consequences of outsourcing ""are the most important barriers to participation. Factors such as ""reinforcing the ongoing oversight and follow-up of health projects by the Ministry of Health. modifying the original use / multipurpose of the project with the aim of attracting investors. enabling private sector funding in collaborative contracts. and encouraging and punishing appropriate medical universities based on Performance appraisal in project outsourcing is the most important factor driving the implementation of partnerships with the private sector. Conclusion: The results of this study showed that ""lack of capacity to define incentives and exemptions in health investment plans. investor uncertainty about government-funded technical and financial studies is the most significant deterrent to participation."" Strengthen surveillance and follow-up of health project assignments. From the Ministry of Health. changing the main user / multipurpose project with the aim of making it attractive to investors is the most important factor driving public- private partnerships.

521,BACKGROUND The gut microbiota (GM) has been proven to play a role in the regulation of host lipid metabolism. which provides a new theory about the pathogenesis of dyslipidemia. However. the associations of GM with dyslipidemia based on sex differences remain unclear and warrant elucidation. AIM To investigate the associations of GM features with serum lipid profiles based on sex differences in a Chinese population. METHODS This study ultimately recruited 142 participants (73 females and 69 males) at Honghui Hospital. Xi'an Jiaotong University. The anthropometric and blood metabolic parameters of all participants were measured. According to their serum lipid levels. female and male participants were classified into a high triglyceride (H{\_}TG) group. a high total cholesterol (H{\_}CHO) group. a low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (L{\_}HDL-C) group. and a control (CON) group with normal serum lipid levels. Fresh fecal samples were collected for 16S rRNA gene sequencing. UPARSE software. QIIME software. the RDP classifier and the FAPROTAX database were used for sequencing analyses. RESULTS The GM composition at the phylum level included Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes as the core GM. Different GM features were identified between females and males. and the associations between GM and serum lipid profiles were different in females and males. The GM features in different dyslipidemia subgroups changed in both female patients and male patients. Proteobacteria. Lactobacillaceae. Lactobacillus and Lactobacillus{\_}salivarius were enriched in H{\_}CHO females compared with CON females. while Coriobacteriia were enriched in L{\_}HDL-C females. In the comparison among the three dyslipidemia subgroups in females. Lactobacillus{\_}salivarius were enriched in H{\_}CHO females. and Prevotellaceae were enriched in L{\_}HDL-C females. Compared with CON or H{\_}TG males. Prevotellaceae. unidentified{\_}Ruminococcaceae. Roseburia and Roseburia{\_}inulinivorans were decreased in L{\_}HDL-C males (P value {\textless} 0.05). and linear discriminant analysis effect size analysis indicated an enrichment of the above GM taxa in H{\_}TG males compared with other male subgroups. Additionally. Roseburia{\_}inulinivorans abundance was positively correlated with serum TG and total cholesterol levels. and Roseburia were positively correlated with serum TG level. Furthermore. Proteobacteria (0.724. 95{\%}CI: 0.567-0.849). Lactobacillaceae (0.703. 95{\%}CI: 0.544-0.832).

522,Introduction: Venezuela and Colombia both adopted measures of containment early in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. However. Venezuela's ongoing humanitarian crisis has decimated its health care system. and forced millions of Venezuelans to flee through its porous border with Colombia. The extensive shared border. and illegal cross-border transit through improvised trails between the two countries are major challenges for public health authorities. We report the first SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Venezuela. and present a snapshot of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemiologic landscape in the Colombian-Venezuelan border region.Methods: We sequenced and assembled viral genomes from total RNA extracted from nasopharyngeal (NP) clinical specimens using a custom reference-based analysis pipeline. Three assemblies obtained were subjected to typing using the Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak LINeages 'Pangolin' tool. A total of 376 publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genomes from South America were obtained from the GISAID database to perform comparative genomic analyses. Additionally. the Wuhan-1 strain was used as reference.Results: We found that two of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Venezuela belonged to the B1 lineage. and the third to the B.1.13 lineage. We observed a point mutation in the Spike protein gene (D614G substitution). previously reported to be associated with increased infectivity. in all three Venezuelan genomes. Additionally. three mutations (R203K/G204R substitution) were present in the nucleocapsid (N) gene of one Venezuelan genome.Conclusions: Genomic sequencing demonstrates similarity between SARS-CoV-2 lineages from Venezuela and viruses collected from patients in bordering areas in Colombia and from Brazil. consistent with cross-border transit despite administrative measures including lockdowns. The presence of mutations associated with increased infectivity in the 3 Venezuelan genomes we report and Colombian SARS-CoV-2 genomes from neighboring borders areas may pose additional challenges for control of SARS-CoV-2 spread in the complex epidemiological landscape in Latin American countries. Public health authorities should carefully follow the progress of the pandemic and its impact on displaced populations within the region.

523,Intestinal bacterial dysbiosis is evident in children with cystic fibrosis (CF) and intestinal viruses may be contributory. given their influence on bacterial species diversity and biochemical cycles. We performed a prospective. case-control study on children with CF and age and gender matched healthy controls (HC). to investigate the composition and function of intestinal viral communities. Stool samples were enriched for viral DNA and RNA by viral extraction. random amplification and purification before sequencing (Illumina MiSeq). Taxonomic assignment of viruses was performed using Vipie. Functional annotation was performed using Virsorter. Inflammation was measured by calprotectin and M2-pyruvate kinase (M2-PK). Eight CF and eight HC subjects were included (50{\%} male. mean age 6.9 +/- 3.0 and 6.4 +/- 5.3 years. respectively. p = 0.8). All CF subjects were pancreatic insufficient. Regarding the intestinal virome. no difference in Shannon index between CF and HC was identified. Taxonomy-based beta-diversity (presence-absence Bray-Curtis dissimilarity) was significantly different between CF and HC (R-2 = 0.12. p = 0.001). Myoviridae. Faecalibacterium phage FP Taranis and unclassified Gokushovirinae were significantly decreased in CF compared with HC (q {\textless} 0.05). In children with CF (compared to HC). the relative abundance of genes annotated to (i) a peptidoglycan-binding domain of the peptidoglycan hydrolases (COG3409) was significantly increased (q{\textless} 0.05) and (ii) capsid protein (F protein) (PF02305.16) was significantly decreased (q{\textless} 0.05). Picornavirales. Picornaviridae. and Enterovirus were found to positively correlate with weight and BMI (r = 0.84. q = 0.01). Single-stranded DNA viruses negatively correlated with M2-PK (r = -0.86. q = 0.048). Children with CF have an altered intestinal virome compared to well-matched HC. with both taxonomic and predicted functional changes. Further exploration of Faecalibacterium phages. Gokushovirinae and phage lysins are warranted. Intestinal viruses and their functions may have important clinical implications for intestinal inflammation and growth in children with CF. potentially providing novel therapeutic targets.

524,"Powdery mildews are the subject of intense research due to their negative impact on agriculture or horticulture. The genetic diversity of these ascomycete fungi has only been surveyed in the last decades to investigate phylogenetic relationships and species boundaries. to propose new taxa. and to assess their biogeographic history. However. many of the resulting studies are revealing only a partial picture because of the uneven species sampling across the globe. Here. we studied three Leveillula collections occurring on wild plant species in the Iberian Peninsula. a region which lacked any previous knowledge on the genus' genetic diversity. Our study provides the first record of L. guilanensis in Europe based on specimens from two distant localities in the Iberian Peninsula, the species was so far known only from Iran. It grew on living Chondrilla juncea and was parasitized by the hyperparasite fungus Ampelomyces quisqualis. The morphological and phylogenetic assignment of another collection to L. lanuginosa is reported as well. Furthermore. we inferred a chronogram based on an Eiysiphales nrITS substitution rate that dated the crown node of Leveillula back to 22.48 million years ago. Clades including the Iberian Peninsula samples originated and diversified through the Neogene (Miocene to Pleistocene). These results suggest an overall older time frame for the evolution of Leveillula compared to previous works. All in all. the present study provides additional avenues for discussing the evolutionary and biogeographic history of this genus of powdery mildews.

525,"Mobile health (M-Health) has become a novel method for HIV prevention and the effects need to be promoted. The study purpose was to exam how a smartphone application (app) reduces HIV risky behaviour in men who have sex with men (MSM). The Safe Behaviour and Screening (SBS) app was developed. and included five features: record. output. and resources connection, information provision, testing services, interaction, and online statistics. A random assignment was used. The experimental group used the SBS app for six months. The control group did not use any intervention. There were 130 participants in the experimental group. and 135 in the control group. The average age of all subjects was 27.38 (SD = 5.56). Compared to the control group. the experimental group had significantly higher mean score of safe behaviour knowledge. motivation. and skills, percentage of condom use during anal intercourse, frequency of searching for testing resources and getting HIV and syphilis tests. The frequency of anal intercourse and recreational drug usage were significantly lower in the experimental group. The SBS app could decrease the HIV risky behaviour among MSM and be applied to HIV prevention and nursing intervention. PU  - ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS.

526,"Introduction In conducting this study. it was our presumption that lipofilling is a necessary and simultaneous adjunct to lifting the middle third of the face in patients with negative lower eyelid vectors. enabling satisfactory and enduring aesthetic results.Materials and Methods Eligible patients met the following criteria: (1) primary midface lift in subperiosteal plane, (2) negative inferior eyelid vectors at preoperative baseline, (3) postoperative monitoring for similar to 2 years, (4) standard pre- and postoperative photo-documentation, (5) proficiency in Italian language, and (6) signed consent for study participation. Informed consent pertaining to photography allowed for subsequent publication. Pertinent patient data were also collected as follows: age. sex. duration of follow-up. type of surgical procedure. related secondary procedures. quantity of fat injected. nature of incision. and patient satisfaction level. Complete randomness was thus conferred during computer-assisted patient assignment to one of two study arms: midface lift only (group 1) or midface lift plus facial lipofilling as a concurrent operation (group 2). All patients completed Italian versions of the FACE-Q module. which were issued by e-mail approximately 2 years postoperatively. Two plastic surgeons reviewed all postoperative photographs of treated patients and rated outcomes on a scale of 1-5. Statistical analysis was powered by standard software expressing categorical data as numbers and percentages and quantitative data as means +/- standard deviations.Results Between January 2016 and March 2018. a total of 56 patients (women 48, men 8) subjected to primary midface lifts in subperiosteal plane at our Plastic Surgery Department met all criteria for study enrollment. Mean patient age was 56.5 years (range 40-70 years). and the mean follow-up period was 2.1 years (range 2-5 years). Differences in postoperative FACE-Q scoring by the two groups were significant (p {\textless} 0.01) across all domains. Outcomes in patients of group 2 remained stable during long-term follow-up. whereas significantly more secondary procedures were pursued by patients of group 1 (p {\textless} 0.01). Compared with group 1. the two reviewers encountered significantly greater satisfaction with surgical outcomes among patients of group 2 (p {\textless} 0.01).Conclusions In FACE-Q scoring. those undergoing lift-and-fill procedures reported the highest satisfaction levels.

527,This Innovative Practice Full Paper notes that recent research has indicated that large numbers of college and university students make limited use of their class textbooks. This is particularly true in terms of assigned readings - whether they are required for the course or not. Students are knowingly depriving themselves of an important means of learning. While the falling use of textbooks among students is concerning. it should be especially so because of the ongoing pandemic. The pandemic has forced much of the secondary educational experience online. limiting forms of in-person lectures and group activities. and severely restricting or rendering impossible hands-on assignments such as labs and projects. It is clear that the current environment students find themselves in is not optimized for learning.In an attempt to increase student understanding of course material. an online. interactive textbook was created using the software platform Top Hat The book is in its first edition. and is for use with the university's engineering course Statics and Mechanics of Materials. It was written and developed by a professor with years of teaching experience and course development. and by a student who had previously taken the course and has worked as a certified tutor for the university. The textbook employs pedagogies designed to increase student understanding of material. such as active learning. and is used in conjunction with a flipped classroom format. To facilitate this approach. the book has readings that are to be completed before lecture in preparation for various class activities. including group assignments and discussions and think-pair-share. Questions are embedded within the assigned readings for the students to check their understanding of the material. These questions provide instant feedback to the students. either informing them their answer was correct. or alerting them it was incorrect and giving hints to help solve the problem.As the textbook makes use of educational strategies known to improve student learning. it is desired to know if the book had a positive impact on their understanding of the course material. One method of evaluating the online text is to compare students' text use with their level of achievement in the course. Two factors related directly to text use were investigated: the number of questions in the textbook students answered correctly (Correctness) and the number of questions in the textbook answered in general (Participation). The students were categorized into three levels (low. medium. and high) based on their respective score for each variable and two. one-way between-subjects analysis of variance (ANOVA) were performed to determine if there existed a significant difference between student textbook usage (participation and correctness) and overall course grades. Post hoc testing was then performed to determine differences between the three groups. Both F-tests were significant. with significant differences found between the different groups for both correctness and participation. The largest difference occurred between the top and bottom thirds of the class with respect to question correctness. with the difference in mean final course grades being a full letter grade.

528,"Security and privacy have become a great concern in cloud computing platforms in which users risk the leakage of their private data. The leakage can happen while the data is at rest (in storage). in processing. or on moving within a cloud or between different cloud infrastructures. e.g.. from private to public clouds. This paper focuses on protecting data ""in processing"". For big data applications. the MapReduce framework has been proven as an efficient solution and has been widely deployed. e.g.. in healthcare and business data analysis. In this article. we propose a trust-based framework for MapReduce in big data processing tasks. Specifically. we first quantify and propose to assign the sensitive values for data and trust values for map and reduce slots. We then compute the trust value of each resource employed in the big data processing tasks. Depending on the data's sensitivity level of a task. the task requires a given level of trust (i.e.. higher sensitive data requires servers/slots with higher trust level). The MapReduce scheduling problem is then formulated as the maximum weighted matching problem of a bipartite graph that aims to maximize the total trust value over all possible assignments subject to various trust requirement of different tasks. The problem is known to be NP-hard. To tackle it. we observe that within a computing node (VM). slots share the same trust value granted from the secured transformation phase. This helps reduce the number of slot nodes of a weight bipartite graph. Leveraging this fact. we propose an efficient heuristic algorithm that achieves 94.7 percent of the optimal solution obtained via exhaustive search. Extensive simulations show that the trust-based scheduling scheme provides much higher protection for data sensitivity while ensuring good performance for big data applications.

529,Causal inference with observational data can be performed under an assumption of no unobserved confounders (unconfoundedness assumption). There is. however. seldom clear subject-matter or empirical evidence for such an assumption. We therefore develop uncertainty intervals for average causal effects based on outcome regression estimators and doubly robust estimators. which provide inference taking into account both sampling variability and uncertainty due to unobserved confounders. In contrast with sampling variation. uncertainty due to unobserved confounding does not decrease with increasing sample size. The intervals introduced are obtained by modeling the treatment assignment mechanism and its correlation with the outcome given the observed confounders. allowing us to derive the bias of the estimators due to unobserved confounders. We are thus also able to contrast the size of the bias due to violation of the unconfoundedness assumption. with bias due to misspecification of the models used to explain potential outcomes. This is illustrated through numerical experiments where bias due to moderate unobserved confounding dominates misspecification bias for typical situations in terms of sample size and modeling assumptions. We also study the empirical coverage of the uncertainty intervals introduced and apply the results to a study of the effect of regular food intake on health. An R-package implementing the inference proposed is available. PU  - WILEY PI  - HOBOKEN PA  - 111 RIVER ST. HOBOKEN 07030-5774. NJ USA
530,With the high altitude and flexible mobility. unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) is becoming a promising technology to cope with the computation-intensive and latency-critical task in prospective Internet of Things. In this paper. we propose a novel MEC system with several ground servers at access points and one aerial server carried by UAV. To balance the vital metrics of the MEC system. computation bits and energy consumption. we aim to maximize the weighted computation efficiency of the system. subject to the constraints on communication and computation resources. minimum computation requirement and UAV's mobility. To this end. a joint optimization problem with the goal of weighted computation efficiency maximization is formulated. First. we analyze the problem and transform it into an equivalent tractable form. Then. we solve the challenging non-convex problem by jointly optimizing the computation task assignment. time slot partition. transmission bandwidth and CPU frequency allocation. transmit power allocation. and UAV's trajectory. based on the Dinkelbach's method. Lagrange duality and successive convex approximation technique. Furthermore. we propose an alternative computation efficiency maximization algorithm. followed by the convergence and complexity analysis. Finally. numerical simulations show that our proposed algorithm significantly improves the computation efficiency compared to benchmark schemes. It is also validated that the proposed algorithm effectively obtains a good tradeoff between the computation task bits and energy consumption of the system.

531,The introduction of e-learning into education offers exceptional opportunities for worldwide access to learning resources. It also provides a new environment with tools to deliver study materials and create novel approaches to learning. LMS Moodle is open source software thought to be the key in the future learning strategies. offers a great range of possibilities and can be easily adapted to a particular subject.We try to enhance quality and attractiveness of mathematical education using Learning Management System (LMS). We wanted that the students could repeat and fix their knowledge in different ways. Therefore. created courses include electronic textbooks. lectures. examples with detailed solutions. as well as assignments and links to interesting mathematical websites. The main objective of this paper is to describe using the quizzes module of LMS Moodle in the process of mathematical education and to analyze obtained research data about usage of these modules by students of the Slovak University of Agriculture in Nitra.We have created two kinds of quizzes. The first type was designed to repeat theoretical knowledge with the possibility of checking the correctness of the selected answer and thus obtaining immediate feedback. The second type contained practical tasks. The students had to calculate the given tasks and then find the correct answer in the offered options. Tests were assigned to them for independent study before written test during the semester. In results we will present the analysis of students' answers. outputs of psychometric analysis with the identification of the appropriateness of the questions stated in the quizzes. and relevance assessment of applied Moodle module for improving the educational process.By applying appropriate e-learning methods. we provide students with the opportunity to study independently over time.

532,Recurrent event data are commonly encountered in observational studies where each subject may experience a particular event repeatedly over time. In this article. we aim to compare cumulative rate functions (CRFs) of two groups when treatment assignment may depend on the unbalanced distribution of confounders. Several estimators based on pseudo-observations are proposed to adjust for the confounding effects. namely inverse probability of treatment weighting estimator. regression model-based estimators. and doubly robust estimators. The proposed marginal regression estimator and doubly robust estimators based on pseudo-observations are shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal. A bootstrap approach is proposed for the variance estimation of the proposed estimators. Model diagnostic plots of residuals are presented to assess the goodness-of-fit for the proposed regression models. A family of adjusted two-sample pseudo-score tests is proposed to compare two CRFs. Simulation studies are conducted to assess finite sample performance of the proposed method. The proposed technique is demonstrated through an application to a hospital readmission data set.

533,"Simple Summary Neuroblastoma is a highly heterogeneous malignancy with a wide range of outcomes from spontaneous regression to fatal chemoresistant disease. as currently treated according to the risk stratification of the Children's Oncology Group (COG). resulting in some high COG risk patients receiving excessive treatment. due to lacking predictors for treatment response. Here. we sought to complement COG risk classification by using the tumor intracellular microbiome. which is part of the tumor's molecular signature. We determine that an intra-tumor microbial gene abundance score. namely M-score. separates the high COG-risk patients into two subpopulations (M-high and M-low) with higher accuracy in risk stratification than the current COG risk assessment. thus sparing a subset of high COG-risk patients from being subjected to traditional high-risk therapies. Currently. most neuroblastoma patients are treated according to the Children's Oncology Group (COG) risk group assignment, however. neuroblastoma's heterogeneity renders only a few predictors for treatment response. resulting in excessive treatment. Here. we sought to couple COG risk classification with tumor intracellular microbiome. which is part of the molecular signature of a tumor. We determine that an intra-tumor microbial gene abundance score. namely M-score. separates the high COG-risk patients into two subpopulations (M-high and M-low) with higher accuracy in risk stratification than the current COG risk assessment. thus sparing a subset of high COG-risk patients from being subjected to traditional high-risk therapies. Mechanistically. the classification power of M-scores implies the effect of CREB over-activation. which may influence the critical genes involved in cellular proliferation. anti-apoptosis. and angiogenesis. affecting tumor cell proliferation survival and metastasis. Thus. intracellular microbiota abundance in neuroblastoma regulates intracellular signals to affect patients' survival. PU  - MDPI PI  - BASEL PA  - ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66. CH-4052 BASEL. SWITZERLAND"
534,"Objective: This article describes the system architecture. training. initial use. and performance of Watson Assistant (WA). an artificial intelligence-based conversational agent. accessible within Micromedex (R).Materials and methods: The number and frequency of intents (target of a user's query) triggered in WA during its initial use were examined, intents triggered over 9 months were compared to the frequency of topics accessed via keyword search of Micromedex. Accuracy of WA intents assigned to 400 queries was compared to assignments by 2 independent subject matter experts (SMEs). with inter-rater reliability measured by Cohen's kappa.Results: In over 126 000 conversations with WA. intents most frequently triggered involved dosing (N = 30 239. 23.9{\%}) and administration (N = 14 520. 11.5{\%}). SMEs with substantial inter-rater agreement (kappa = 0.71) agreed with intent mapping in 247 of 400 queries (62{\%}). including 16 queries related to content that WA and SMEs agreed was unavailable in WA. SMEs found 57 (14{\%}) of 400 queries incorrectly mapped by WA, 112 (28{\%}) queries unanswerable by WA included queries that were either ambiguous. contained unrecognized typographical errors. or addressed topics unavailable to WA. Of the queries answerable by WA (288). SMEs determined 231 (80{\%}) were correctly linked to an intent.Discussion: A conversational agent successfully linked most queries to intents in Micromedex. Ongoing system training seeks to widen the scope of WA and improve matching capabilities.Conclusion: WA enabled Micromedex users to obtain answers to many medication-related questions using natural language. with the conversational agent facilitating mapping to a broader distribution of topics than standard keyword searches.

535,Parameters of reproductive success are important to the management of wildlife populations. Genetic monitoring can be an effective approach for acquiring this important demographic information when traditional methods are unsuccessful. inefficient. or too expensive. This study demonstrates a novel application of genetic data opportunistically collected from harvested game to estimate a minimum annual count of breeding packs of gray wolves (Canis lupus) and to provide a coarse index of harvest vulnerability of young of the year (YOY) across packs. We used 18 microsatellite loci to genotype 98 gray wolf YOY from 2014 and 105 from 2015 harvested in Idaho. USA. Using this genotype data. we reconstructed sibling groups for each cohort using the program COLONY and treated full-sibling litters as proxies for unique packs. In addition to evaluating our marker panel using simulations. we assessed the accuracy of empirical relationship assignments by adding YOY of known relationship from long-term study packs to the dataset (27 individuals from 2014 and 61 from 2015) and tracking correctly reconstructed relationships. We varied COLONY input parameters to evaluate the power of relationship assignments under conditions that may be encountered when working with empirical data. We also compared COLONY's estimates of effective number of breeders based on sibship frequency to estimates based on a commonly used linkage-disequilibrium method. All COLONY runs for both cohorts correctly identified the known sibling relationships. Among the other individuals. changes in the geographic clustering of putative siblings. probabilities of inclusion and exclusion for reconstructed sibling groups. and consistency of relationship assignments across COLONY runs suggested that marker number had a larger effect on accuracy than access to population-level genetic data. Our estimates of breeding packs subjected to harvest within the state (52 for 2014 and 63 for 2015) differed from estimates reported by Idaho Department of Fish and Game by {\textless}= 6 for both years. Among packs that had pups harvested. most packs had 1-2 YOY harvested. whereas other packs had as many as 5 YOY harvested. All estimates of the number of effective breeders had overlapping confidence intervals regardless of method. though sibship frequency-based estimates had larger confidence intervals than estimates using the linkage disequilibrium method. Our study shows that sibling relationships can be accurately and reliably reconstructed from harvested gray wolves. and demonstrates a valuable new use of samples collected through harvest.

536,The main aim of ex situ programmes in conservation is to provide a suitable source of individuals for future reintroductions or reinforcement of existing populations. A fundamental prerequisite is creating and maintaining healthy and sustainable captive populations that show high levels of phenotypic and genetic similarity to their wild counterparts. The Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) is a model of a locally extinct species that has been subject to long-term captive breeding and of past and ongoing reintroduction efforts. To test for genetic suitability of ex situ population. a comparative genetic evaluation including in situ populations was undertaken. The assignment analysis of 97 captive lynx from 45 European zoos. wildlife parks and private breeds was performed using 124 lynx from different wild Eurasian populations belonging to three evolutionary lineages: the Carpathian. the Northern. and the Siberian lynx. The results showed a high proportion of Siberian lynx (51{\%}) in the European captive lynx population. Remaining captive animals were assigned to either the Carpathian (28{\%}). or the Northern lynx lineage (13{\%}). Admixture between lineages was rather low (8{\%}). Notably. no or very low difference in genetic diversity was detected between the wild and captive lynx populations. Our results support the potential of the captive population to provide genetically suitable individuals for genetic rescue programmes. The transfer of genes between isolated populations. including those in captivity. should become an important management tool to preserve genetic variability and prevent inbreeding depression in native and reintroduced populations of this iconic predator.

537,The husk tomato (Physalis philadelphica Lam.) is an important Solanaceae native to Mesoamerica that is grown for its green fruit used as an important ingredient in domestic and international cuisine. Nevertheless. husk tomato plants with symptoms resembling those caused by 'Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum' (CLso) have been observed during the last decade in plantations located in the State of Mexico. Michoacan and Sinaloa in Mexico. These areas are located near other solanaceous crops where Bactericera cockerelli the well-known psyllid transmitter of CLso is frequently present. Thus. the goal of this study was to determine if CLso haplotypes are present in husk tomato varieties in commercial fields in Mexico. From 2015 to 2016. plants and fruit showing evident symptoms of CLso infection. as well as psyllids were collected in these states and assayed by PCR for CLso using primer sets OA2/OI2c and LpFrag 1-25F/427R. Phylogenetic reconstruction was performed with Bayesian analysis and maximum likelihood methods using amplicon sequences obtained in this work along with those deposited in the GenBank database corresponding to the CLso detected in Solanaceae. Apiaceae. and Convolvulaceae host families. In addition. all the sequences were subjected to haplotype determination through an analysis of DNA polymorphisms using the DnaSP software. Furthermore. quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed using CLso-specific primers and probes. Phylogenetic reconstruction and qPCR confirmed the presence of CLso in plants. seeds and insect-vectors. and CLso sequences from plants and seeds completely matched haplotype B. whereas CLso haplotypes A and B were detected in B. cockerelli psyllids. Polymorphism analysis identified a novel Convolvulaceae-associated CLso haplotype. which was named haplotype H. The results of this study will enable the dissemination of infected seeds to new husk tomato production areas to be avoided.

538,Fair division. a key concern in the design of many social institutions. has for 70 years been the subject of interdisciplinary research at the interface of mathematics. economics. and game theory. Motivated by the proliferation of moneyless transactions on the internet. the computer science community has recently taken a deep interest in fairness principles and practical division rules. The resulting literature brings a fresh concern for computational simplicity (scalable rules) and realistic implementation. In this review of the most salient fair division results of the past 30 years. I concentrate on division rules with the best potential for practical implementation. The critical design parameter is the message space that the agents must use to report their individual preferences. A simple preference domain is key both to realistic implementation and to the existence of division rules with strong normative and incentive properties. I discuss successively the one-dimensional single-peaked domain. Leontief utilities. ordinal ranking. dichotomous preferences. and additive utilities. Some of the theoretical results in the latter domain are already implemented in the user-friendly SPLIDDIT platform (http://spliddit.org).

Theoretical calculations. such as optimized geometry. electronic. vibrational spectroscopic. intermolecular interactions. and insilico screening were performed. DFT at hybrid functional B3LYP was chosen. and the 6-311++G(d. p) level of theory was used for all simulations. The first three rings of the compound are in chair conformation (trans arrangement). while the remaining two rings are in boat conformation (cis arrangement). Transannular. flagpole. and stereo electronic hyperconjugative interactions are observable throughout the optimal geometry because of the conformation therein. Non-covalent H center dot center dot center dot H interactions is also confirmed by Hrishfeld surface analysis. NBO and NPA analyses have confirmed stereo electronic hyperconjugative interactions and C-H center dot center dot center dot O intramolecular hydrogen bonding interactions. The estimated vibrational wavenumbers and the experimentally determined values have an excellent correlation. The TD-DFT computations were performed both in solvent (chloroform) and gaseous phase. and agree with the experimental values. The molecule was tested insilico against tuberculosis protein 4FDO using the Schrodinger suite's Glide docking software. After the docking studies. the compound's drug-likeness and ADMET predictions were calculated. and the results indicated that it could be exploited as a tuberculosis treatment option.

However. few studies aimed to perform a comprehensive and thorough analysis of those registered trials in the aforementioned field based on ClinicalTrials.gov and the ICTRP portal site. Methods Our study covered the clinical researches about stem cell therapy enrolling subjects aged under 18 years old registered on ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP before May 18. 2021. A cross-sectional study was implemented to comprehensively describe and analyze the included trials that met the criteria. Results were available on ClinicalTrials.gov. and publications related to the included trials were identified. All analyses were performed utilizing the SPSS 25.0 software. Results Eventually. 202 clinical trials were included and evaluated. The participant number of trials tended to be small, 71.3{\%} were enrolled {\textless} 50. And 93.5{\%} of the subjects were without gender restrictions. Till May 2020. 112 trials had been preliminary completed. of which only 39 trials had published papers or uploaded results. Most (73.6{\%}) of 186 interventional trials were in phase 1 and phase 2. where 131 (70.4{\%}) trials were conducted without masking. and 26.3{\%} trials were randomized, 55.4{\%} trials were performed single group assignment. Of 16 observational trials. case-only/series took up 37.5{\%}. Hematopoietic stem cells (37.1{\%}) and mesenchymal stem cells (36.1{\%}) were mostly employed. while umbilical cord blood (UCB)-derived cells (24.3{\%}) and bone marrow (BM)-derived cells (20.8{\%}) were the major sources. Conclusions This study provided an overall picture of utilizing stem cells for treatment and management of childhood diseases. Since clinical trials in this area are insufficient in quantity and quality. there is an urgent need of larger. better-designed trials. Increased investment in clinical research of stem cell treatment products should be carried out to achieve the transformation of results as soon as possible. Moreover. it is important to optimize the management of the registration platform and shorten the time it takes for research results to be published. PU  - BMC PI  - LONDON PA  - CAMPUS. 4 CRINAN ST.

541,Multiple quantitative methods for single-case experimental design data have been applied to multiple-baseline. withdrawal. and reversal designs. The advanced data analytic techniques historically applied to single-case design data are primarily applicable to designs that involve clear sequential phases such as repeated measurement during baseline and treatment phases. but these techniques may not be valid for alternating treatment design (ATD) data where two or more treatments are rapidly alternated. Some recently proposed data analytic techniques applicable to ATD are reviewed. For ATDs with random assignment of condition ordering. the Edgington's randomization test is one type of inferential statistical technique that can complement descriptive data analytic techniques for comparing data paths and for assessing the consistency of effects across blocks in which different conditions are being compared. In addition. several recently developed graphical representations are presented. alongside the commonly used time series line graph. The quantitative and graphical data analytic techniques are illustrated with two previously published data sets. Apart from discussing the potential advantages provided by each of these data analytic techniques. barriers to applying them are reduced by disseminating open access software to quantify or graph data from ATDs.

543,The influence of listening to classical music on integral indices of the activity of the regulatory mechanisms of the heart rhythm in students after teaching load was tested with the method of variational pulsometry accordingly to R.M Baevsky procedure. Registration and analysis of ECG was realized on Pentium 4 in three experimental situations: before the start of lessons (norm). after lessons. after listening to the music. Two types of response of students 'functional state to the teaching load: sympathetic and parasympathetic have been established. After teaching load music therapy session was found to led to the shift of levels of all examined indices of heart rhythm toward the original data (norm). most expressed in students with a sympathetic response type.
544,"For the Internet of things. having sensors in devices used for video surveillance services. such as cameras. is crucial. The advancement of edge computing technology has enabled high computing capacity and the handling of massive data sets. The concept of cloudlets is employed in edge computing for in-network processing. especially for large-size multimedia data processing. Cloudlets are essential for services with high computing costs. Contrary to traditional cloud computing. data can be offloaded to in-network devices and core clouds. thereby improving the quality of service and enhancing resource utilization. However. the trade-off between network transmissions and nodal processes with delay-aware multimedia traffic has been demonstrated to be an NP-complete problem. The problem is presented as a mathematical formula to maximize the minimal delay gap between the tolerable event delay. sending time. and processing time. The problem is subject to in-network processing node assignment. routing paths. transmission capacities. computing capacities. and the effective service period. The Lagrangian approach was employed to evaluate the method proposed in this study, a near-optimal solution was obtained. and several experiments were performed to demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing methods.

545,Edge computing is a promising technology that offers data analysis and computing for Internet of Things (IoT) services at the network edge. It has the potential to significantly reduce the latency and improve the reliability of IoT services by allowing computation workloads and local data generated by IoT devices to be offloaded to edge nodes. This paper aims to develop algorithms for efficient provision of both job assignment and resource allocation for edge computing networks. The main objective is to minimize the long-term average of the response time delay subject to constraints on computation resources and power consumption. We apply a drift-plus-penalty based Lyapunov optimization approach to convert the original problem into an upper bound optimization problem. We then relax the latter to a convex optimization problem. Finally. a distributed algorithm based on branch-and-bound approach is provided and the gap between the distributed algorithm solution and the optimal solution of the original problem is theoretically analyzed. Numerical results based on extensive experiments have demonstrated that our distributed algorithm can achieve the required performance of edge computing that supports IoT systems. under static traffic conditions as well as under dynamic environments with time-varying traffic.

546,The international higher education sector is increasingly reliant on precariously employed non-tenured academic staff. Such staff are variously labelled as contingent. part-time. temporary or adjunct and. in Australia and New Zealand. as 'casual' or 'sessional' employees. The international trend is for these academics to deliver a significant proportion of teaching load. There is evidence that in some universities the majority of undergraduate courses are delivered by sessional academics. While there is evidence that these employees are typically committed to their teaching. their students and their discipline. there is little work on how their employment conditions affect the quality of teaching and learning. Previous research emphasises the conditions and experiences of academics so employed rather than the impact of such employment practices on their ability to deliver high quality teaching and learning outcomes. Thus further research in this area is necessary since this group of academic is increasingly pivotal in the learning experience of many students. particularly in the early years of higher education. In this research project a population of 130 sessional lecturers. tutors and markers in the disciplines of business and law at an Australian regional university were invited to participate in an online survey to report on their perceptions of their academic development and support. their teaching practices. and their motivation and satisfaction with their employment situation. The impact of these factors on the ability of such employees to deliver high quality teaching and learning outcomes for students is analysed. Results of the study are presented in the form of barriers and opportunities to improve teaching and learning for sessional academics.

547,With the growing popularity of smartphone devices. the demand for mobile application programmers has been increasing. particularly for the most popular mobile platform Android. Then. Android application programming has become one of the most important subjects that students should learn in professional schools and universities in IT departments. To assist self-studies of students. we have developed Android Programming Learning Assistance System (APLAS). To guide students to reach correct answers for given assignments. APLAS adopts the Test-Driven Development (TDD) method to validate student answers automatically using JUnit and Robolectric. The learning model for APLAS consists of four stages where each stage has several topics. In this paper. we implement Advanced Widgets as the second topic in the Interactive Application stage and evaluate it through applications to students in an IT department in Indonesia.

548,Objectives IgA Nephropathy (IgAN) is common chronic kidney disease with a high incidence. This study aims to analyze comprehensively therapeutic clinical trials for IgAN registered on ClinicalTrials.gov. Methods Therapeutic trials for IgAN registered on ClinicalTrials.gov. up to 15 August 2021 were obtained. The general characteristics. features of experimental design. treatment strategies. and some main inclusion criteria and outcome measures were accessed. Results A total of 104 therapeutic clinical trials for IgAN were extracted on ClinicalTrials.gov up to 15 August 2021. Most of these trials explored the treatment for primary IgAN confirmed by renal biopsy in adults. Only 9{\%} of all selected trials had results. Forty-five percent of trials recruited 50 or fewer participants. and 73{\%} were adults or older adults. 99{\%} of trials were interventional studies. and of all the interventional trials. 70{\%} of trials were randomized. and 68{\%} exercised a parallel assignment of intervention model. Immunosuppression was the most studied for the treatment of IgAN. Moreover. many novel agents had been increasingly studied in recent years. Furthermore. the inclusion criteria and primary outcome measures in these trials were diverse. and the level of proteinuria and change of proteinuria levels were the most used as inclusion criteria and primary outcome. respectively. Conclusions The majority of therapeutic trials for IgAN were randomized. none masking and parallel-assignment interventional studies. primarily recruiting adult patients as research subjects. These trials had relatively small sample sizes and short observation. Thus. more large-scale. multicenter. and randomized controlled trials are still needed to improve the management for IgAN.

549,"Background: Wearable activity trackers are regarded as a new opportunity to deliver health promotion interventions. Indeed. while the prediction of active behaviors is currently primarily relying on the processing of accelerometer sensor data. the emergence of smart clothes with multi-sensing capacities is offering new possibilities. Algorithms able to process data from a variety of smart devices and classify daily life activities could therefore be of particular importance to achieve a more accurate evaluation of physical behaviors. This study aims to (1) develop an activity recognition algorithm based on the processing of plantar pressure information provided by a smart-shoe prototype and (2) to determine the optimal hardware and software configurations.Method: Seventeen subjects wore a pair of smart-shoe prototypes composed of plantar pressure measurement insoles. and they performed the following nine activities: sitting. standing. walking on a flat surface. walking upstairs. walking downstairs. walking up a slope. running. cycling. and completing office work. The insole featured seven pressure sensors. For each activity. at least four minutes of plantar pressure data were collected. The plantar pressure data were cut in overlapping windows of different lengths and 167 features were extracted for each window. Data were split into training and test samples using a subject-wise assignment method. A random forest model was trained to recognize activity. The resulting activity recognition algorithms were evaluated on the test sample. A multi hold-out procedure allowed repeating the operation with 5 different assignments. The analytic conditions were modulated to test (1) different window lengths (1-60 seconds). (2) some selected sensor configurations and (3) different numbers of data features.Results: A window length of 20 s was found to be optimum and therefore used for the rest of the analysis. Using all the sensors and all 167 features. the smart shoes predicted the activities with an average success of 89{\%}. ""Running"" demonstrated the highest sensitivity (100{\%}). ""Walking up a slope"" was linked with the lowest performance (63{\%}). with the majority of the false negatives being ""walking on a flat surface"" and ""walking upstairs."" Some 2- and 3-sensor configurations were linked with an average success rate of 87{\%}. Reducing the number of features down to 20 does not alter significantly the performance of the algorithm.Conclusion: High-performance human behavior recognition using plantar pressure data only is possible. In the future. smart-shoe devices could contribute to the evaluation of daily physical activities. Minimalist configurations integrating only a small number of sensors and computing a reduced number of selected features could maintain a satisfying performance. Future experiments must include a more heterogeneous population. PU  - PEERJ INC PI  - LONDON PA  - 341-345 OLD ST. THIRD FLR. LONDON. EC1V 9LL. ENGLAND"
550,Mobile computation offloading (MCO) is a technique that can help reduce energy consumption of mobile devices (MDs) by offloading their tasks to more powerful devices for execution. In MCO. the offloading decision for a task depends on availability of both communication and computation resource. In small cell cellular networks. cloudlet servers are usually co-located with the small base stations (SBSs). As a result. offloading decisions of the MDs are coupled with SBS associations. while strong overlapping coverage between the SBSs can result in complicated interference conditions in wireless transmissions that affect the offloading performance. In this paper. offloading decisions and SBS associations are jointly optimized with transmission power and channel assignments in a small cell cellular network. The objective is to minimize the total energy consumption of all MDs. subject to task's latency constraints. The problem is first formulated as a mixed binary nonlinear programming problem. then transformed and solved using the general bender decomposition (GBD). A heuristic solution is proposed that recursively allows more MDs to make offloading decisions based on the current transmission conditions. Compared to using GBD. this solution results in much lower worst-case complexity. while achieving good energy performance for a wide range of system parameters.

551,"Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANET) is the framework for social networking with a realistic framework. In theMANETenvironment. based on the query. information is transmitted between the sender and receiver. In the MANET network. the nodes within the communication range are involved in data transmission. Even the nodes that lie outside of the communication range are involved in the transmission of relay messages. However. due to the openness and frequent mobility of nodes. they are subjected to the vast range of security threats inMANET. Hence. it is necessary to develop an appropriate security mechanism for the dataMANET environment for data transmission. This paper proposed a security framework for the MANET network signature escrow scheme. The proposed framework uses the centralised Software Defined Network (SDN) with an ECC cryptographic technique. The developed security framework is stated as Escrow Elliptical Curve Cryptography SDN (EsECC{\_}SDN) for attack detection and classification. The developed EsECC-SDN was adopted in two stages for attack classification and detection: (1) to perform secure data transmission between nodes SDN performs encryption and decryption of the data, and (2) to detect and classifies the attack in theMANET hyper alert based HiddenMarkovModel Transductive Deep Learning. Furthermore. the EsECC{\_}SDN is involved in the assignment of labels in the transmitted data in the database (DB). The escrow handles these processes. and attacks are evaluated using the hyper alert. The labels are assigned based on the k-medoids attack clustering through label assignment through a transductive deep learning model. The proposed model uses the CICIDS dataset for attack detection and classification. The developed framework EsECC{\_}SDN's performance is compared to that of other classifiers such as AdaBoost. Regression. and Decision Tree. The performance of the proposed EsECC{\_}SDN exhibits similar to 3{\%} improved performance compared with conventional techniques.

552,The popularity of drones is rapidly increasing across the different sectors of the economy. Aerial capabilities and relatively low costs make drones the perfect solution to improve the efficiency of operations that are typically carried out by humans. Besides automating field operations. drones acting de facto as a swarm can serve as an ad hoc cloud infrastructure built on top of computing and storage resources available across the swarm members and other elements. Even in the absence of Internet connectivity. this cloud can serve the workloads generated by the swarm members and the field agents. By considering the practical example of a swarm-powered 3-D reconstruction application on top of such cloud infrastructure. we present a new optimization problem for the efficient generation and execution of multinode computing workloads subject to data geolocation and clustering constraints. The objective is the minimization of the overall computing times. including both networking delays caused by the interdrone data transmission and computation delays. We prove that the problem is NP-hard and present two combinatorial formulations to model it. Computational results on the solution of the formulations show that one of them can be used to solve. within the configured time-limit. more than 50{\%} of the considered real-world instances involving up to two hundred images and six drones.

553,The Atlantic Coast Migratory Stock (ACMS) of striped bass Morone saxatilis is supported by spawning populations in Chesapeake Bay and the Hudson. Delaware. and Roanoke rivers. Spawning success and recruitment differs among these populations and temporally within them and thus their relative abundances shift over time. The ACMS is subject to harvest and other sources of mortality at many Atlantic Coast locales. Effective management of these populations would benefit from knowledge of the relative contributions of these populations to the ACMS. We used microsatellite DNA analysis to measure the extent of genetic differentiation among those populations that contribute to the ACMS and to quantify their contributions to recreational harvest in 2019 at Montauk. New York. We found genetic homogeneity between the Delaware River and Chesapeake Bay populations. but significant allelic differentiation among the Hudson River. combined Delaware River-Chesapeake Bay. and Roanoke River populations. In simulations of single mixture samples. assignment accuracies for the Chesapeake-Delaware. Hudson River. and Roanoke River collections were high at 96 {\%} (95 {\%} CI=0.921. 0.999). 93 {\%} (0.863. 0.979). and 81 {\%} (0.726. 0.866). respectively. Mixture analysis and Individual Based Assignment testing were used to quantify contributions to the 2019 Montauk fishery. Mixture analysis indicated 86 {\%}. 8.5 {\%}. and 5.5 {\%} contributions for the Chesapeake-Delaware. Hudson River and Roanoke River populations. respectively. Similarly. Individual Based Assignments showed the Chesapeake-Delaware population as the largest contributor (78 {\%}). followed by the Hudson River (12 {\%}). and the Roanoke River (10 {\%}). Furthermore. we found no significant differences in relative contributions across the five-month recreational fishing season nor among size-classes of striped bass. Lastly. the risk of consuming a Hudson River striped bass from Montauk containing a considerably high concentration of PCBs is minimal. Future stock composition analysis of Atlantic migratory striped bass would benefit from standardization of the approach. with DNA analysis from collections made at a single strategic location offering advantages.

554,In virtualized data centers. consolidation of virtual machines (VMs) on minimizing the number of total physical machines (PMs) has been recognized as a very efficient approach. This paper considers the energy-efficient consolidation of VMs in a cloud datacenter. Concentrating on CPU-intensive applications. the objective is to schedule all requests non-preemptively. subjecting to constraints of PM capacities and running time interval spans. to make the total energy consumption of all PMs is minimized (called MinTE for abbreviation). The MinTE problem is NP-complete in general. We propose a self-adaptive approach called SAVE. The approach makes decisions of the assignment and migration of VMs by probabilistic processes and is based exclusively on local information. Both simulation and real environment test show that our proposed method SAVE can reduce energy consumption about 30{\%} against VMWare DRS and 10-20{\%} against ecoCloud on average. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms the existing method and achieves significant energy savings and high utilization.

555,With the development of the Internet of Things. the data that needs to be processed is increasing rapidly. Therefore. the collaboration of cloud and edge emerges as the times require. Edge nodes are mainly responsible for collecting data. and decide to process the data locally or offload to cloud data centers. Cloud data centers are suitable for data analysis. model training. and managing edge nodes. In this article. we focus on the task assignment problems in collaborative edge and cloud environments and study it in a distributed. non-cooperative environment. An M/M/1 queueing model is established to characterize the task transmission. Because of the multi-core processors. we set an M/M/C queueing model to characterize the task computation. We consider the problem from the perspective of game theory and formulate it into a non-cooperative game among multi-agents (multiple edge data centers) in which each agent is informed with incomplete information (allocation strategies) of others. For each agent. we define a function of the expected cost of tasks as the disutility function. and minimize it subject to the QoS constraint. We analyze the existence of Nash equilibrium and develop a Greedy Energy-aware Algorithm (GEA) to choose active servers using the Limit Searching Algorithm (LSA) to find the ceiling utilization. Then we propose the Best Response Algorithm (BRA) to optimize the utility function. The convergence of the BRA algorithm has been discussed. Finally. the results demonstrate that the BRA algorithm can get a solution close to Nash equilibrium and reach it quickly. PU  - IEEE COMPUTER SOC PI  - LOS ALAMITOS PA  - 10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE.

556,The structure assignment and conformational analysis of cinnamic derivative N-benzyl-N-(2-(cyclohexylamino)-2-oxoethyl) cinnamamide (NGI25) was carried out through Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Molecular Dynamics (MD) and Quantum Mechanics (QM). i.e. semiempirical and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. Moreover. Homonuclear (COSY. NOESY) and heteronuclear (HSQC. HMBC) experiments were applied to assign its protons and carbons. After structure identification. NGI25 was subjected to computational calculations to reveal its most favorable conformations. In particular. MD studies were performed in two different solvents. DMSO of intermediate polarity and hydrophobic CHCl3. The obtained results suggest that NGI25 adopts similar conformations in both environments. In particular. the two aromatic rings of the molecule reside in spatial vicinity. while they remain quite distant from the cyclohexane. 2D NOESY experiments confirmed the in silico MD and QM calculations. Finally. molecular docking calculations were performed in order to reveal possible enzyme-targets for NGI25. Swiss target module was used to guide the discovery of new targets based on the structure of NGI. Indeed. it was predicted that NGI25 inhibited butyrylcholinesterase (BCHE) and lipoxygenase (LOX). Molecular docking experiments. followed by Molecular Dynamics studies. confirmed the favorable binding of NGI25 to both enzymes. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

557,Cloudlet deployment and resource allocation for mobile users (MUs) have been extensively studied in existing works for computation resource scarcity. However. most of them failed to jointly consider the two techniques together. and the selfishness of cloudlet and access point (AP) are ignored. Inspired by the group-buying mechanism. this paper proposes three-stage auction schemes by combining cloudlet placement and resource assignment. to improve the social welfare subject to the economic properties. We first divide all MUs into some small groups according to the associated APs. Then the MUs in same group can trade with cloudlets in a group-buying way through the APs. Finally. the MUs pay for the cloudlets if they are the winners in the auction scheme. We prove that our auction schemes can work in polynomial time. We also provide the proofs for economic properties in theory. For the purpose of performance comparison. we compare the proposed schemes with HAF. which is a centralized cloudlet placement scheme without auction. Numerical results confirm the correctness and efficiency of the proposed schemes. PU  - SPRINGER PI  - DORDRECHT PA  - VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30. 3311 GZ DORDRECHT. NETHERLANDS
558,An agricultural backhoe is an important machine designed for multiple assignments in agriculture and livestock. Due to severe working conditions. agricultural backhoe elements are subjected to high loads. Therefore. a structural design must provide a safe machine under all loading conditions at minimum weight and cost. In this work. a 3D model of an agricultural backhoe was proposed. to be used in tractors category II according to the classification of the ASABE 5217 standard. In the structural design of the agricultural backhoe Theoretical Analysis (TA). Finite Element Analysis (FEA). Response Surface Methodology (RSM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) were used. A finite element model of the agricultural backhoe in the critical position was developed. considering a maximum breakout force according to SAE J1179 standard. The finite element model was theoretically validated through a comparison between numerical and theoretical normal stresses at twelve strategic points of the agricultural backhoe components. finding a maximum absolute difference of 7.0 {\%}. Also. a mass reduction of the principal backhoe components (bucket. arm. boom and links) was done. using Central Composite Design (CCD) under RSM in a commercial FE software and ANN technique with Neural Lab software. A mass reduction of the initial agricultural backhoe model of 24.8{\%} (from 446.3 kg to 335.4 kg) was achieved using the RSM technique. with an increment on the maximum von Mises stress of 6.8{\%} (from 117.4 MPa to 125.4 MPa). as well as a reduction of the minimum safety factor of 4.8{\%} (from 2.94 to 2.80). ANN allowed predicting the results obtained by RSM to reduce the boom mass with a correlation coefficient of 0.96. using 80.0{\%} of data and around 13.0{\%} less time. This study showed that a combination of RSM and ANN techniques with TA and FEA provides useful results to reduce the structural mass of agricultural equipments. thus it is recommended to decrease the number of numerical case studies and the solution time with satisfactory results.

559,Writing assignments offer valuable student learning experiences in both live and online courses. But concerns about the challenges and extra work of marking. and about plagiarism. often deter instructors from using them. I used a writing assignment successfully over 20 years in a one-term invertebrate biology course. despite enrolments exceeding 100. Structured to maximally engage students yet minimize marking load. the assignment often yielded gems of stories for use in subsequent lectures. The Annotated Bibliography assignment asks students: (a) to precis the justification. main results. and significance of three papers from the primary scientific literature in under 250 words each. and (b) to provide a short (150 word) summary of the broader story connecting the three papers. Students liked this assignment because they could choose any aspect of the biology of any invertebrate genus. This inspired them to explore the literature out of personal interest. It's appealing for instructors. because annotations are compact and therefore easy to read. mark. and inspect for plagiarism. It is appealing to host universities. because it generates extensive use of library resources and motivates students to learn how to use them. and online taxonomic databases. effectively. Here I provide: (a) instructions for this assignment. (b) a straightforward marking rubric. (c) two examples of excellent submissions. and (d) comments on the risk and extent of plagiarism. Appendices provide: detailed instructions. a sample annotation with comments to guide student writing. an online submission web page. an online administrator web page. and PHP scripts for both web pages.

563,Summary: The Depth Importance in Precision Medicine (DIPM) method is a classification tree designed for the identification of subgroups relevant to the precision medicine setting. In this setting. a relevant subgroup is a subgroup in which subjects perform either especially well or poorly with a particular treatment assignment. Herein. we introduce. dipm. a novel R package that implements the DIPM method using R code that calls a program in C.Availability and implementation: dipm is available under a GPL-3 licence on CRAN https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dipm/index.html and at https://ysph.yale.edu/c2s2/software/dipm. It is continuously being developed at https://github.com/chenvict/dipm.Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics Advances online.
564,Automatic grading of code and computational practices offers several beneficial practical and pedagogical advantages and is now possible using a variety of techniques. Recently. MathWorks has introduced a native solution for MATLAB code: MATLAB Grader. This web-based interface facilitates task submission and automatic grading based on preprogrammed criteria. The subject of Mechatronics (DISA-ETSINF-UPV) was used as a test where the in -class grading of some of the computer programming labs sessions have been replaced by automatically graded assignments. mainly using the MATLAB Grader platform.

565,Simulations were used in lecture-based courses. Thermodynamics I and Thermodynamics II. for demonstration purposes and as digital assignments. Digital assignments were separate from the customary pencil {\&} paper homework given once a week. The primary objective was to model the flow and heat transfer in a system. reinforce theoretical concepts. and allow study of more complex two- and three-dimensional problems.Students encounter fluid flow and heat transfer in the sophomore course. Thermodynamics I. for the first time. Velocity. pressure and temperature fields are quite complicated even for simple geometries. hard to visualize. and difficult to understand. Digital assignments go beyond basic theoretical concepts and relatively simple pencil {\&} paper problems. Initially. there were 6 digital assignments in each course. After the first offerings and assessments. the number of assignments is expected to grow to 8-10. Scaffolding of digital assignments ensured that simulations gain in complexity as students become more familiar with both the theoretical underpinnings and the software interface.Our Mechanical Engineering program. has a freshmen graphic communication course incorporating AutoCAD and a junior CAD course with SolidWorks and Ansys. This provided both a challenge and an opportunity for lecture-based thermofluids courses positioned 'in between.' Modern computational skills were obtained outside the classroom. and that was accomplished with effective use of an on-line environment. Ansys Fluent was chosen to present and reinforce thermo-fluids fundamentals. Each digital assignment had a mesh. detailed grading criteria. and supplementary documentation. Students worked on the: (1) problem set up in the preprocessor-stage. (2) solver. and (3) postprocessor. This approach helped students (1) understand the flow and heat transfer inside the system as well as the application of conservation of mass and energy. (2) understand and interpret results by comparing them with theoretical and experimental data. (3) develop modern technical skills relevant to the demands of Industry 4.0. and (4) develop research capabilities.Simulations in the classroom and as digital assignments are a representation of the real world. and provide an egalitarian and unrestricted way for students to interact with it. acquiring skills and an appreciation for subject matter as well as the engineering profession. Semester long discussions on various aspects of digital assignments help develop a mentor-mentee bond. This approach to teaching. research and mentoring does not depend on access to laboratory facilities and funding that can reach only a limited number of students. It encourages students' spirit of inquiry. and ultimately leads to a professional development opportunities beyond the classroom setting.

566,In this article. we study an energy-efficient nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) enabled multiaccess edge computing (MEC) system with strict latency requirements. We aim to minimize the energy consumption of all users by optimizing the resource allocation (including power and computation resources) and subchannel assignment. subject to the given latency constraint. The formulated problem. however. is a nonconvex combinatorial optimization problem. Nevertheless. we decompose the problem into a resource allocation subproblem and a subchannel assignment subproblem. and then solve the two subproblems iteratively. On one hand. we investigate the hidden convexity of the resource allocation subproblem under the optimal conditions. and propose an efficient algorithm to optimally allocate the resources by dual decomposition methods. On the other hand. we formulate the subchannel assignment subproblem into an integer linear programming problem and strictly prove that the problem is nondeterministic polynomial-time hard. We then solve it optimally by branch-and-bound methods. which is shown to be efficient in extensive simulations. Moreover. through considerable simulation results. we show that our proposed algorithm helps greatly reduce users' energy consumption when communication resources (e.g.. bandwidth) are limited. Additionally. it is verified that NOMA outperforms orthogonal multiple access in multiuser latency-sensitive MEC systems.

567,Atlantic herring in International Council for Exploration of the Sea (ICES) Divisions 6.a. 7.b-c comprises at least three populations. distinguished by temporal and spatial differences in spawning. which have until recently been managed as two stocks defined by geographical delineators. Outside of spawning the populations form mixed aggregations. which are the subject of acoustic surveys. The inability to distinguish the populations has prevented the development of separate survey indices and separate stock assessments. A panel of 45 single-nucleotide polymorphisms. derived from whole-genome sequencing. were used to genotype 3480 baseline spawning samples (2014-2021). A temporally stable baseline comprising 2316 herring from populations known to inhabit Division 6.a was used to develop a genetic assignment method. with a self-assignment accuracy greater than 90{\%}. The long-term temporal stability of the assignment model was validated by assigning archive (2003-2004) baseline samples (270 individuals) with a high level of accuracy. Assignment of non-baseline samples (1514 individuals) from Divisions 6.a. 7.b-c indicated previously unrecognized levels of mixing of populations outside of the spawning season. The genetic markers and assignment models presented constitute a 'toolbox' that can be used for the assignment of herring caught in mixed survey and commercial catches in Division 6.a into their population of origin with a high level of accuracy.

568,"The Public Management and Administration (PMA - in Spanish ""Gestion y Administracion Publica"". GAP) degree at the Universitat Jaume I (UJI) will close the first four years cycle in the next academic year (2011-2012 to 2015-2016). Graduates in PMA have many and varied career expectative. ranging from the local administration until European and international administration. or both the public and private sector. The PMA degree was designed according the Bologna degree structure adapted for Spain by a statute law: 4 + 1, four years or 240 European Credit Transfer System (ECTS) credits (60 cr/y) assigned to the degree. and one year or 60 ECTS credits assigned to the master.Recently. the Ministry of Education issued a regulatory law (National Official Newsletter - BOE- 2015, 29. Feb 3: 8088- 8091, http://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2015/02/03/pdfs/BOE-A-2015-943.pdf) for organising the university studies in a different structure according the rest of Bologna studies in Europe: 3 + 2, three years or 180 European Credit Transfer System (ECTS) credits (60 cr/y) assigned to the degree. and two years or 120 ECTS credits assigned to the master. Essentially. this law corrects the great mistake the then executive did more than ten years ago imposing longer degrees than the rest of the Bologna territory. But. really. creates a new problem because merely abolish the 4+1 structure for new and existing degrees. and. in addition. it has to be applied since the new academic year 2015-2016. just when the existing educational surveillance authorities finish their own organisation revision. Other problem is not all degrees have created a ""natural"" continuity in related masters. At Spain. since a degree or master is posed to the university authorities. until it starts to run. it may take more than two years. and every study is officially reviewed (by the educational surveillance authorities) every six years. General speaking. the environment of the Bologna studies could be characterised by a parameter representing the total time spent by students to reach a master degree. and it is set as invariant of five years in the expression n1 + n2 = 5. when n1 = 1.... 4 and n2 = 1.... 4 (some specific studies. as Medicine. are excluded because they are longer). Therefore. we cannot dismiss that next Spanish executives issue new regulatory laws setting studies' curricula as '1+4'. '2+3' too. or (come back to) 4+1 structures.This is a new challenge for the PMA degree in its fourth year: to move or not to the new 3+2 curriculum design. despite it is not yet consolidated. But some questions must be answered and a bunch of tethers should be released before entering in the formal process to create a new 3 years PMA degree and the corresponding 2 years master. The main questions are the following: (1) Could be more interesting for prospective students make a degree of three years instead of four years?, (2) What master or masters' catalogue UJI could offer as a continuation of the ""+2""?, (3) How has to change the financial system in public universities to face the re-structuration and compete against private universities?, (4) How can. UJI and departments. manage the teaching load loss related to the migration from ""4+"" to ""3+"". and the consequent wide reorganization of official teaching assignments? The aim of this work is to reflect on these issues and try to find approximate answers based on our current and past educational and academic experience.

569,"This paper proposes a main and secondary controller assignment model against multiple controller failures in software defined networks considering latency between switches and controllers. The survivability guarantee of each switch is satisfied by assigning a set of controllers. where one of them works as the main controller to control the switch. Given assigned controllers. we introduce a policy-based approach to automatically specify the main controllers in each failure pattern. which leads to a lightweight configuration on a switch. We define the average-case expected latency. the worst-case expected latency. and the expected number of switches within a latency bound. as three objectives to be optimized in three different problems. We prove that a low latency first policy achieves the optimal objective for each considered problem. We formulate the proposed controller assignment model with different goals as three mixed integer linear programming problems. We prove the NP-completeness for all the three problems. A greedy algorithm with polynomial time complexity is developed, we show that it provides a 1/2-approximation for the case without the survivability guarantee constraint. The numerical results observe that the proposed model obtains the optimal objective value with the computation time about 10(2) times shorter than that of a baseline that introduces decision variables to determine the main controllers.

570,"Printed Circuit Board (PCB) design is part of the syllabus of the bachelor's degree in industrial Electronics Engineering from University of Almeria. Due to time constraints and the sheer number of topics to cover in the electronics related subjects. PCB design through software tools is reduced to an introduction as a lesson of the last year's subjects.Even when this approach has sufficed in regard of students fulfilling the course needs (namely develop a PCB using a software design tool of choice). student discomfort with current plan along with academic performance decreasing over the years has shown room for improvement. A survey was introduced to 4th year students to grasp their level of confidence and opinion. Results reveal that many students find the amount of time required to finish their assignments while acquiring skill on the software tool cumbersome.The students' perception is attributed to the late introduction of PCB design software in the degree. This might imply an imbalance between the main transversal skills in electronic related subjects. namely physical instrumentation. simulation and circuit design. where PCB design software belongs to the last one. Consequently. PCB design through software tools should be introduced early in the degree. making possible for students to develop that set of transversal skill much further.To improve the current situation and boost student development in circuit design. as teachers belonging to the Electronic Technology Area of Knowledge. have decided to develop a PCB design Small Private Online Course (SPOC). Even when aiming for a mainly autonomous. fully online course. its primary goal is local, to serve as support to provide a more solid PCB design background for our students.Along this paper we revise the course from a curricular development point of view. At first the objectives we need to fulfill are laid out for all the main aspects of the course. then explaining the strategies considered to cover them. The compatibility of the designed course with the rest of the subjects and its scalability into a fully-fledged SPOC are also considered.

571,Computer networks and power transmission networks are treated as capacitated flow networks. A capacitated flow network may partially fail due to maintenance. Therefore. the capacity of each edge should be optimally assigned to face critical situations-i.e.. to keep the network functioning normally in the case of failure at one or more edges. The robust design problem (RDP) in a capacitated flow network is to search for the minimum capacity assignment of each edge such that the network still survived even under the edge's failure. The RDP is known as NP-hard. Thus. capacity assignment problem subject to system reliability and total capacity constraints is studied in this paper. The problem is formulated mathematically. and a genetic algorithm is proposed to determine the optimal solution. The optimal solution found by the proposed algorithm is characterized by maximum reliability and minimum total capacity. Some numerical examples are presented to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed approach. PU  - TECH SCIENCE PRESS PI  - HENDERSON PA  - 871 CORONADO CENTER DR. SUTE 200. HENDERSON. NV 89052 USA
572,Information networks are critical media for various applications of cloud computing and the Internet of Things. How to maintain the system reliability of an information network is an important issue for system supervisors. The system reliability is influenced by the capacities of the lines assigned to the edges that connect the vertices of the information network. where each line should operate to provide a certain capacity or fail. This study aims to maximize the system reliability of an information network by determining the optimal binary-state line assignment under an assignment budget constraint. In contrast to previous studies related to system reliability maximization. this study considers a time threshold in system reliability evaluation. In addition. the information network is regarded as a stochastic information network. as each edge may include several binary-state lines and provide multiple states. A method based on minimal paths and genetic algorithm (GA) with elite replacement is developed to evaluate the system reliability and search for the optimal solution. Several numerical experiments are conducted to show that the GA not only determines the exact solution but also exhibits higher computational efficiency than several well-known meta-heuristic algorithms.

An online tool CircuitsMaster.com (CM). aiming make the design of electronics with Arduino faster and easier is presented in this paper. Three diverse needs of designers that wish to include electronics with Arduino in their projects are explained. CM uses a combination of end-user development paradigms to answer to these needs. Based on results from a user evaluation. those who used CM were significantly faster in creating typical electronics assignments when compared to subjects who did not use CM. Therefore. such tools seem to have a salient role to play for designers that wish to develop IoT products. PU  - SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG PI  - CHAM PA  - GEWERBESTRASSE 11. CHAM.

574,The authors model the class size and teaching load decisions of academic departments in terms of a departmental utility function. Utility is postulated to be asymmetric around class size and teaching load norms. and variables for curricular structure. disciplinary domain. and institutional type are taken into account. Maximization of the utility function produces decision rules for the number of sections to be offered for each course. and hence the faculty's overall teaching load. A nonlinear estimator is developed for the decision rules' parameters and applied to data from four liberal arts colleges and two research universities. Results are consistent with theories about faculty discretionary time and with expectations about the effects of curricular structure on class size. The paper concludes with a discussion about the effects of enrollment uncertainty on faculty load decisions. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

575,There are many different constraints when assigning agents to roles within a group. One such constraint is role coupling.. It is a complex problem that cannot be solved without appropriate modelling tools. The Role-Based Collaboration (RBC) and its Environments - Classes. Agents. Roles. Groups. and Objects (E-CARGO) model is such a tool. This paper proposes a solution to the role assignment problem in consideration of role coupling through the application of this tool.The problem can be described as a Group Multi-Role Assignment with Coupled Roles (GMRACR). It is considered as a multi-objective non-linear optimization problem. Useful solutions are implemented by using a Linear Programming (LP) solver. i.e.. the IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Platform (CPLEX). Experiments are then conducted to verify the proposed solutions.Contributions of this paper include formalization of the GMRACR problem. This provides the foundation for finding an objetive solution and advances the state of the art on the subject of assignment. The proposed solutions provide a solid foundation for decision making in dealing with similar issues. PU  - IEEE PI  - NEW YORK PA  - 345 E 47TH ST. NEW YORK. NY 10017 USA
576,This paper describes the research aimed at identifying students' attitudes to the model of teaching computer science subjects with an emphasis on the development of creativity. cooperation. social skills of students as well as critical thinking. The described research is part of extensive research. whose main objective was to determine the impact of the proposed teaching model on the students' results in computer science software engineering (SWE) and business process modelling (MPP) subjects. Emphasis is placed not only on creativity. professional skills and knowledge as well as the development of student cooperation in group project development. but also critical thinking and verbal abilities developed through student evaluation of other students' projects.Moreover. the evaluation of projects by both teachers and students is more objective. The research had two primary objectives. The first was to find out whether there is a statistically significant difference in attitudes of students towards SWE and MPP. i.e. whether the application of different forms of project assignment (group / individual assignment) influenced students' attitude to subjects. The second objective was to find out whether there was a statistically significant difference in the attitudes of men and women to the form of project assignment and evaluation. To answer the research questions. we used a questionnaire - constructed based on the semantic differential. It was created in MOODLE using Feedback activity. The attitude to the assessed subjects was measured using several 5-degree Likert scales in terms of selected factors. An anonymous questionnaire was filled in by 52 respondents online (48{\%} of SWE and MPP students). T-tests were used for statistical verification of established hypotheses.The obtained results indicate that students consider the subject of MPP. where they worked out an individual project as less demanding. Compared to the subject SWE. in which they worked out a group project. The results confirmed a statistically significant difference in the perception of the difficulty of SWE and MPP. The results obtained also indicate that women prefer the group assignment of the project. The results also showed that students consider the feedback from the teacher to be more useful. There was also a statistically significant difference in the perception of the usefulness of feedback from classmates and teachers.The obtained results were analysed. and the results of the analysis will be used to modify the proposed model of teaching computer science subjects with an emphasis on the development of creativity. independence. social skills of students as well as critical thinking.

577,We consider a target assignment problem for a team of mobile autonomous agents. Agents utilize a wireless communication network subject to failures to determine which target each agent should cover. Being unaware of each others' locations and which targets they intend to cover. each agent has control over its mobility and communication in addition to which target they select. Given the setup. we propose a decentralized algorithm based on the distributed fictitious play algorithm in which agents reason about the selections to decide which target to select. whether to communicate or not. and where to move. Numerical experiments illustrate physical coverage of targets in finite time and the potential benefits of communication censoring. PU  - IEEE PI  - NEW YORK PA  - 345 E 47TH ST. NEW YORK.

578,The Decree of August 10. 2007 (normative development LOE) establishes that students had to learn only one foreign language with a class schedule which exceeded 4 hours per week in each of the cycles. However. the Decree of March 17. 2015 (normative development LOMCE) collects up to a second foreign language and with a direct teaching load of language lessons higher than twice the previous regulations. In addition. the curricular development map in this last law presents the evaluation criteria of each of the cycle and their relation to the rest of the curricular elements. It does not have as a reference the contents for the whole curriculum development. as in the LOE. In this respect. although the trend of teaching foreign languages in Andalusia follows very ambitious patterns through the development of their curricula from the LOE to the LOMCE. it prioritizes the development of skills at the expense of the accumulation of content. This teaching intent is a big step towards another dimension in the way of acquiring key competences. PU  - UNIV PABLO OLAVIDE. FAC CIENCIAS SOCIALES PI  - SEVILLA PA  - CTRA UTRERA KM 1.

To address this gap. we developed a mixed methods survey to gather faculty perceptions of facilitators and barriers to using the existing academic integrity procedures. policies. resources. and supports required to promote academic integrity. In this article. we report the data collected from 330 participants at four Canadian universities. Responses pointed to the importance of individual factors. such as duty to promote academic integrity. as well as contextual factors. such as teaching load. class size. class format. availability of teaching assistant support. and consistency of policies and procedures. in supporting or hindering academic integrity. We also situated these results within a micro (individual). meso (departmental). macro (institutional). and mega (community) framework. Results from this study contribute to the growing body of empirical evidence about faculty perspectives on academic integrity in Canadian higher education and can inform the continued development of existing academic integrity supports at universities.

580,This study explored the prioritization of English-medium instruction (EMI) teachers' needs for faculty development and institutional support by applying a best-worst scaling approach to an EMI program in Japan. This prioritization is important as EMI programs need management under various constraints (e.g.. time. budget. and teachers). This study also investigated how teachers' needs for institutional support differ by English language competence and EMI teaching experience and their relationship with EMI programs (e.g.. full-time or adjunct). Questionnaire surveys administered to 38 EMI teachers revealed that. overall. faculty development (FD) program menus training teaching styles. speaking skills. communication skills. and respecting the diversity of students should be prioritized such that it varies depending on the teachers' English language competence levels but not their teaching experience. Irrespective of their relationship with EMI programs. the recognition and appreciation of their burdens. efforts. and contributions is most needed. There are noticeable differences based on their position over the necessity of pedagogical guidelines. teaching load. and economic incentive. PU  - MDPI PI  - BASEL PA  - ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66.

582,Teaching a language subject in school is often referred to as being different and unique compared to teaching a non-language subject. However. the few existing studies examining this claim have mainly investigated the viewpoints of teachers who only teach one language. thus failing to achieve a comparison based on teachers' actual lived experiences of teaching two different subjects. The present study was designed to address this gap by exploring 11 upper secondary school teachers' perceptions of similarities and differences between teaching English and a non-language subject. Austria and Norway were chosen as contexts for the study since both countries qualify state secondary school teachers to teach a minimum of two subjects simultaneously as part of their regular teaching load. The analysis of the semi-structured interviews revealed that the teaching of various subjects shares some similarities but is highly influenced by contextual factors. The most striking finding was the perceived different status of subjects across contexts and the consequences of this for teachers and learners. The findings underline the importance of contextualizing data and understanding the ecology in which teaching and learning of any subject or any language takes place.

583,"The study sought to explore educator views on implementation practices of life orientation skills education (LSE) for senior high school students. Participants were 15 guidance and counselling teachers from a rural district of Eswatini (females = 7). The educators responded to semi-structured questions and focus group discussion interviews on the life orientation skills implementation practices they engaged in. Thematic analysis of the data indicated the educators to consider the following important to their implementation practices: knowledge and skills practices in guidance and counselling, training in basic counselling skills, and motivation to effectively implement LSE. The educators considered content knowledge and pedagogy skills important for effective teaching of decision-making and problem-solving skills to students. They also perceived training in basic counselling skills such as listening. acceptance. and empathising as important for teaching of LSE, as well as the incentivising of LSE through extra-compensation and reduction of teaching load. The educators perceived further training needs in basic counselling skills and supplemental material resources to enhance implementation of LSE. These findings suggest a need for continuing professional development of educators to better equip them for sustainable LSE implementation practices with high school students.

584,"This article deals with the life and work of the Belgian legal historian R.C. van Caene em. It shows how van Caenegem's work was influenced by his teachers. first of all FrancoisLouis Ganshof. but also many others like Theodore Plucknett. Van Caenegem's research was very diverse and addressed different groups of readers. so that most of them only know a fragment of his work. Van Caenegem learned from Ganshof's mistakes. Unlike his master. van Caenegem took an interest in sociology and he did not hesitate to publish the grand overviews of history which Ganshof had stopped writing in the second half of his career. Many of van Caenegem'slmoks on English. medieval and legal history were a product of his teaching. Whereas the books for the students in Ghent. where van Caenegem was burdened by a heavy teaching load. presented a complete survey, the books for select groups of foreign students cherry-picked from legal history and took part in discussions on larger debates. Van Caenegem's many articles offer a better insight into his personal evolution from a scholar who started out as a jurist. but very soon lost interest in dogmatic legal history and preferred to investigate the lawmakers instead of the law itself. As a historian. van Caenegetn put the middle ages first. because in his opinion the middle ages laid the foundations for the modern rule of law. However. these 'modem' middle ages only started in the twelfth century. Although he claimed that the future of legal historical research lays in teamwork. van Caenegetn himself remained an indvidualistic scholar.

585,The inequities faced by women in academic Medicine before the COVID-19 pandemic are well established. However. there is little formal data regarding exactly how the pandemic has affected faculty. This cross-sectional study investigated the impact of the pandemic on responsibilities at home. work. and mental health according to gender identification. faculty rank. and faculty appointment. In February 2021. an online questionnaire was broadly distributed to academic medicine faculty. Respondents were asked to provide demographic data. answer questions about their responsibilities at home and work. mental health. and how the pandemic has influenced these. Respondents were also asked to document what their institution(s) can do to help faculty through the pandemic. Responses were analyzed via Pearson's chi-square tests and thematic analysis. Women faculty were more likely to be responsible for the care of others (70{\%}. p = 0.014). and the impact was negative. especially for early career faculty (p = 0.019). Productivity in research. teaching. and clinical practice were negatively impacted. with women feeling this in clinical practice (p = 0.005). increased teaching load (p = 0.042). and inadequate work environment (p = 0.013). In the areas of self-care and mental health. women (p {\textless} 0.001). early career-faculty (p {\textless} 0.001). and clinical faculty (p = 0.029) were more negatively impacted. Early-career women were more likely to fear retribution. Five themes emerged. including Flexible Expectations. Support. Mental Health. Compensation. and Communication.

It is necessary to add to these competences the acquisition of the essential knowledge to perform basic laboratory operations as well as the ability to perform simple mathematical calculations and basic statistical notions. This work focuses on the challenge of developing transversal activities to improve general and basic student's skills [1].In the 2018/2019 academic year. an average of 60 students (depending on the subject) were enrolled in the first course of Gastronomy and Culinary Arts degree. to which they were given an initial questionnaire in order to know their prior knowledge and academic trajectory. Based on the obtained results. some deficiencies were detected such as: insufficient computer skills. insufficient ability to read and understand a foreign language and poor ability to write academic works. In order to improve these deficiencies. the following educational actions have been carried out in the science subjects: a) Reading a scientific research article in English. b) Seminar of materials of laboratory and basic laboratory operations. c) Basic mathematical calculations. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of these approaches. some instruments were developed collecting qualitative data through continuous students and professor feedback. As a result of the present project. new teaching tools are available that have made possible to improve the basic skills of the students.

588,"We consider a principal who periodically offers a fixed and costly nonmonetary reward to agents to incentivize them to invest effort over the long run. An agent's output. as a function of his effort. is a priori uncertain and is worth a fixed per-unit value to the principal. The principal's goal is to design an attractive reward policy that specifies how the rewards are to be given to an agent over time based on that agent's past performance. This problem. which we denote by P. is motivated by practical examples from both academia (e.g.. a reduced teaching load) and industry (e.g.. ""Supplier of the Year"" awards). The following ""limited-term"" (LT) reward policy structure has been quite popular in practice. The principal evaluates each agent periodically, if an agent's performance over a certain (limited) number of periods in the immediate past exceeds a predefined threshold. then the principal rewards him for a certain (limited) number of periods in the immediate future. When agents' outputs are deterministic in their efforts. we show that there always exists an optimal policy that is an LT policy and also. obtain such a policy. When agents' outputs are stochastic. we show that the class of LT policies may not contain any optimal policy of problem P but is guaranteed to contain policies that are arbitrarily near optimal. Given any epsilon {\textgreater} 0. we show how to obtain an LT policy whose performance is within e of that of an optimal policy. This guarantee depends crucially on the use of sufficiently long histories of the agents' outputs. We also analyze LT policies with short histories and derive structural insights on the role played by (i) the length of the available history and (ii) the variability in the random variable governing an agent's output. We show that the average performance of these policies is within 5{\%} of the optimum. justifying their popularity in practice. We then introduce and analyze the class of ""score-based"" reward policies, we show that this class is guaranteed to contain an optimal policy and also. obtain such a policy. Finally. we analyze a generalization in which the principal has a limited number for rewards in any given period and show that the class of score-based policies. with modifications to accommodate the limited availability of the rewards. continues to contain an optimal solution for the principal.

589,Objectives: of the present cross sectional study were to analyze the offer of subjects with communication skills in the nursing degree in Spain and to describe the distribution of these subjects. Documentary. systematic and independent search of web pages from Spanish universities was carried out to collect the following variables: subjects with communication skills. course in which the subject is taught. type of teaching (exclusive or combined). type of subject (compulsory or optional) and number of credits on communication skills. Although an average of 3.6 subjects per center was offered. most of the subjects were combined and with little communication content load. In one third of the centers. the offer was below 2.3 credits. Only 1 in 6 centers had exclusive communication skills subjects. and a quarter of them were optional. The teaching load of communication contents was highest in optional subjects. The offer of communication skills contents in Spanish Nursing Schools was scarce and very heterogeneous between centers and between courses in a center. with excessive presence of combined and optional subjects. Our results may be useful when developing the teaching guides for subjects with communication skills. as well as when defining communication competencies in the different Nursing Schools.

590,Objective - To synthesize student narratives on searching for an item in the library and to identify information literacy threshold concepts students encountered during their searching.Design - Constant comparative analysis.Setting - Academic library at an urban American university.Subjects - A sample of 97 1-to-2 page ungraded first year student essays.Methods - A library assignment was developed for first year students in a required academic skills course. Students wrote the essay for peer mentors. After completing the essay. students were asked if they wanted to participate in the study. For the assignment. students were asked to find a library item of interest and write a reflective essay on the process. Essays were analyzed using NVIVO software. The researchers developed codes independently. then came together to review. discuss and recode the essays. Using the constant comparison method. themes were identified from the coding. Narrative analysis was used to understand the coding in the context of the students' experiences.Main Results - The authors outlined various search paths that the students described in their essays. The main emotional responses in the essays were surprise. confusion. and excitement. Three ACRL Framework IL concepts were identified in the analysis: Scholarship as Conversation. Searching as Strategic Exploration. and Research as Inquiry. Scholarship as a Conversation was exemplified through students' selection of a library item. Students chose topics that were of academic interest or associated with personal identity. In the essays. students explained their connection to the item they found. making the connection to the ongoing scholarly conversation. Searching as Strategic Exploration was expressed through student descriptions of connecting the call number to the subject classifications. Some students sailed through. whereas others encountered challenges. Some found that previous library mental models failed. found the catalogue overwhelming. or thought the organization of material was at fault rather than their own skills. Some students described how they overcame their challenges. Students also discussed balancing self-reliance and seeking help when searching for an item. This related to the ACRL frames of Research as Inquiry and Searching as Strategic Exploration. Attitudes on seeking help ranged from complete reliance to anxiety.Conclusion - This library assignment offered students the opportunity to pursue their own interests and goals. It also encouraged exploration. problem-solving. and reflection. The assignment design allowed students to grapple with information literacy threshold concepts in a safe and independent environment. demonstrating learning and engagement with academia.

591,Purpose To investigate faculty integration of service-learning into radiologic science curricula and its effects on faculty and students.Methods An online survey was distributed to radiologic science faculty to assess the status of service-learning in radiologic science education. Invitations were sent to 2351 faculty in diagnostic medical sonography. nuclear medicine technology. radiation therapy. and radiography programs. Quantitative analysis using descriptive statistics was performed on the raw data. and mind maps were created from responses to open-ended questions for qualitative analysis.Results A total of 444 surveys were returned. for a 19{\%} response rate. Faculty who incorporated service-learning into their courses reported outcomes of increased professionalism. leadership. career skills. empathy. and community awareness. Primary deterrents for integrating service-learning into curricula were lack of faculty and student time and logistical challenges.Discussion The most profound professional benefits of service-learning reported were increased community awareness and relationships among faculty. community. and students. Faculty also indicated that service-learning improved professional effectiveness in terms of knowledge and application. Survey results indicated that service-learning provides students with experiences relevant to the environment they will encounter after graduation. Faculty who use service-learning reported additional benefits for themselves and their students. including having a richer understanding of the community and its members. which ultimately improves critical soft-skills of practice.Conclusion Faculty who use service-learning in their courses and those who plan to use it in the future reported that logistical management and institutional support in the form of release time (ie. counting course development time toward teaching load requirements) are of paramount importance. This type of support would help engage faculty in developing and maintaining service-learning coursework. PU  - AMER SOC RADIOLOGIC TECHNOLOGISTS PI  - ALBUQUERQUE PA  - 15000 CENTRAL AVE. SE.

592,The purpose of this paper is twofold: To measure school technical efficiency and to identify the determinants of elementary school performance among Mexican states. Our panel data consist of 48.645 public elementary schools observed annually from 2009 to 2011. a period where subnational states administered most of the educational expenditure. We propose a two-stage analysis. In the first stage. the stochastic frontier analysis is used to calculate elementary schools' technical efficiency. In the second stage. efficiency is regressed on school characteristics and environmental variables using panel data analysis while capturing state heterogeneity. We find that primary schools have important inputs under their control that affects educational outcomes. The principal's non-teaching load. infrastructure. teaching experience. and expenditure per student all have a positive and significant effect on efficiency. As for state-level characteristics. we find that states' primary school spending is not necessarily positively linked to efficiency. Finally. we observe that fragmentation and regionalization of teachers' unions negatively affect efficiency in elementary public education. PU  - UNIV NACIONAL AUTONOMA MEXICO.

594,"The efficient administration of public resources and teaching human capital have been topics of permanent interest at the Universidad de Costa Rica, however. in a convoluted and uncertain budgetary situation such as the one currently facing the Institution and. in general. the country. this theme acquires greater relevance and the evaluation of academic loads of the teaching staff becomes a vital instrument for decision-making by part of the higher authorities. In the late 1970s. the university administration implemented a permanent evaluation system of the activities assigned to the teaching staff. through which it was intended. in addition to systematizing objective and precise information regarding the work of the academic units. the institutional dynamics and the service provided by the University, determine the financial needs related to the hiring of academic staff and. within the framework of the social contract that the University maintains with Costa Rican society. make university management transparent. assist in the accountability process and strengthen the institutional internal control system. Despite the fact that the main objective of the evaluation of academic teaching loads has not experienced significant variations over time. in the course of its existence. it has registered important operational changes. mainly due to three elements: the diversification of the activities carried out by academic staff, the gradual incorporation of technology in the evaluation process, and the modification of the institutional normative framework that regulates the assignment and administration of the academic teaching load of the teaching staff. an aspect that. given its relevance. is reviewed in this article. which. concomitantly. attempts to elucidate some fundamental conceptual elements to understand this evaluation and point out the existing link between this evaluative exercise and the construct of educational quality.

595,"Developed in Northern Ontario. Canada. Integrated Clinical Learning (ICL) involves a team of clinical teachers from a range of health professions teaching a team of students and trainees together in common community and clinical settings. It is the balanced integration of educational strategies to develop healthcare providers and team-based competencies focused on improving the quality of care. Learning outcomes are developed with and in consideration of the goals of patients or the community through relational learning that mirrors patient-centred care. Implementing ICL requires a systematic approach that addresses the practical issues and enhances the quality of experience for all involved. These practicalities include academic institutions valuing ICL through the appointment and support of primary care clinicians as academic staff with protected time, the provision of physical space. as well as clinical and teaching equipment, and the appointment of local administrative coordinators. The team approach shares the teaching load with the multiple students actually teaching each other so that the load on individual clinicians is less than for one student at a time. Through ICL. students are learning from patients and developing a service-oriented professional identity. The patient and family centred nature of ICL helps bridge the primary care-secondary care divide as students follow their patients into and out of hospital services. This is positive for patients and specialists and provides authentic learning for students. ICL enhances the quality of care, the quality of learning, and the quality of professional satisfaction for primary care clinical teachers.

596,"The increasingly digitized healthcare system requires new skills from all those involved. In order to impart these competencies. appropriate courses must be developed at educational institutions. In view of the rapid development of new aspects of digitization. this presents a challenge, suitable teaching formats must be developed successively. The establishment of cross-location teaching networks is one way to better meet training needs and to make the necessary spectrum of educational content available. As part of the Medical Informatics Initiative. the HiGHmed consortium is establishing such a teaching network. in the field of medical informatics. which covers many topics related to the digitization of the health care system.Various problem areas in the German education system were identified that hinder the development of the teaching network. These problem areas were prioritized firstly according to the urgency of the solution from the point of view of the HiGHmed consortium and secondly according to existing competencies in the participating societies. A workshop on the four most relevant topics was organized with experts from the German Society for Medical Informatics. Biometry and Epidemiology (GMDS). the Society for Medical Education (GMA) and the HiGHmed consortium. These are:1. recognition of exam results from teaching modules that are offered digitally and across locations. and their integration into existing curricula,2. recognition of digital. cross-location teaching in the teachers' teaching load,3. nationwide uniform competencies for teachers. in order to be able to conduct digital teaching effectively and with comparable quality,4. technical infrastructure to efficiently and securely communicate and manage the recognition of exam results between educational institutions.For all subject areas. existing preliminary work was identified on the basis of working questions. and short- and long-term needs for action were formulated. Finally. a need for the redesign of a technologically supported syntactic and semantic interoperability of learning performance recording was identified.

597,Investigating learner behavior is an increasingly important research topic in online learning. Learning styles and cognitive traits have been the subjects of research in this area. Although learning institutions use Learning Management Systems such as Moodle. Claroline. and Blackboard to facilitate teaching. the platforms do not have features for analyzing data and identifying behavior such as learning styles and cognitive traits. Instead. they only produce certain statistical reports from the daily access records. Even though complex models have been proposed in the literature. most studies are based on a single behavior such as learning styles or cognitive traits but not both. Only a few have investigated a combination of cognition-based theories such as working memory capacity and psychology-based ones such as learning styles. Thus. this study sought to answer the research question of whether it was possible to establish a methodology for the estimation of learning styles and cognitive traits from a learning management system. The study combined the Felder-Silverman Learning Style Model and Cognitive Trait Model as theoretical frameworks to identify behavior in a Learning Management System. This study designed a model for extracting records from Learning Management Systems access records to estimate learning style and cognitive traits. From this. a prototype was developed to estimate the learning style and cognitive traits for each student. The model was evaluated by administering manual tools to students in a classroom environment then comparing the results gathered against those estimated by the model. The results analyzed using Kappa statistics demonstrated the interrater reliability results were moderately in agreement. Taken together. these results suggest that it is possible to estimate the learning styles and cognitive traits of a learner in a Learning Management System. The information generated by the model can be used by tutors to provide a conducive online learning environment where learners with similar behavior ask each other for help. This can reduce the teaching load for online tutors because learners themselves act as a teaching resource. Information on learning styles and cognitive styles can also facilitate online group formation by isolating the individual factors that contribute to team success.

598,"There is no doubt that the characteristics of the pedagogical community influence the quality of school education: its problems are often associated with the effectiveness of teachers training and their professional growth. On the other hand. the quality of the school environment and the conditions of pedagogical work are important factors for both the positive education of schoolchildren and its real results. In this perspective. the effectiveness of the education system becomes apparent in comparison with similar systems. That is why the data of international empirical studies aimed at studying the quality of education today are extremely important both for the country as a whole and for its different regions. To take measures for the development of the pedagogical community of the Kirov region. we made a comprehensive analysis of the teaching staff of the regional pedagogical community. The concept is based on materials from the third international study Teaching and Learning International Survey (TALIS 2018). The purpose of this article is to compare the qualities of regional school teachers and their pedagogical practice with similar indicators in foreign countries. The author of the article. on the grounds of the comparison of working conditions. professional education and development of teachers. justifies the need for administrative decisions in personnel policy. The leading research methods here are the collection of data. obtained by questioning in maintaining feedback from teachers. analyzing the conditions of pedagogical practices. modeling and statistical processing of research results. As a result of a study conducted in 2018-2019. in which 1025 teachers of secondary schools from the Kirov region took part. the author of the article found: teachers spend. on the average. 44 astronomical hours per week to perform their duties. besides it takes urban teachers 4 hours more to make their work as compared with rural teachers, the teaching load of the younger age group teachers is 1.5 times greater than that of the older age group teachers, foreign teachers spend 6 hours a week less to perform their official duties in comparison with teachers of the Kirov region, teachers spend most of their time on individual planning. preparing for lessons. and on general administrative work. while participating in extracurricular activities and communicating with parents takes the least amount of time in the structure of official duties. The professional knowledge of teachers acquired in the process of their education is estimated below the average level from the level of full preparedness to perform their professional duties, every fifth educator notes a high interest in learning the technologies of individual teaching. teaching children with special needs and class supervision issues. The theoretical significance of the article is due to its contribution to the development of scientific ideas about the quality of school teachers in comparison with the national educational systems of other countries. Practical use of the research results allows us to build a trajectory of work with pedagogical staff based on working out and implementing a set of measures for the development of the pedagogical community of the regional educational system.

601,Spatial awareness and the ability to analyze spatial objects. manipulate them and assess the effect thereof. is a key competence for industrial designers. Skills are gradually built up throughout most educational design programs. starting with exercises on technical drawings and reconstruction or classification of spatial objects from isometric projections and CAD practice. The accuracy in which spatial assignments are conducted and the amount of effort required to fulfill them. highly depend on individual insight. interests and persistence. Thus each individual has its own struggles and learning curve to master the structure of spatial objects in aesthetic and functional design. Virtual reality (VR) is a promising tool to expose subjects to objects with complex spatial structure. and even manipulate and design spatial characteristics of such objects. The advantage of displaying spatial objects in VR. compared to representations by projecting them on a screen or paper. could be that subjects could more accurately assess spatial properties of and object and its full geometrical and/or mechanical complexity. when exposed to that object in VR. Immersive experience of spatial objects. could not only result in faster acquiring spatial insights. but also potentially with less effort. We propose that acquiring spatial insight in VR could leverage individual differences in skills and talents and that under this proposition VR can be used as a promising tool in design education. A first step in underpinning this hypothesis. is acquisition of cognitive workload that can be used and compared both in VR and in a classical teaching context. We use electroencephalography (EEG) to assess brain activity through wearable plug and play headset (Wearable Sensing-DSI 7). This equipment is combined with VR (Oculus). We use QStates classification software to compare brain waves when conducting spatial assessments on paper and in VR. This gives us a measure of cognitive workload. as a ratio of a resulting from subject records with a presumed 'high' workload. A total number of eight records of subjects were suited for comparison. No significant difference was found between EEG signals (paried t-test. p = 0.57). However the assessment of cognitive workload was successfully validated through a questionnaire. The method could be used to set up reliable constructs for learning techniques for spatial insights. PU  - SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG PI  - CHAM PA  - GEWERBESTRASSE 11. CHAM. CH-6330.

603,"One feature of distance learning in Operations Management is the need for a frequent verification of the students' knowledge and skills. This is important both for students and lecturers. Ensuring an intensive two-way connection between the student and the lecturer is of particular importance for guaranteeing successful learning. This report provides a method for automating the evaluation of students' assignments. The method is a result of a summary of the author's experience in distance education for Business Administration students in the subject of Operations Management. The method uses two tools. The first one requires development of a specific form in spreadsheet software. The student completes the form by performing the required calculations. answers and explains how he has solved the tasks. Every task contains one parameter that is dependent on the last few digits of each student's faculty number. Thus. tasks are different for each student. When done. the student sends his file through the distance learning platform. Through a simple VBA program. the teacher summarizes the results obtained. A model was developed to calculate the correct answer for each task and compare it with the student's answers. Logically. the software can evaluate only the correctness of the calculations. but not the text responses. This is the lecturer's responsibility. The second tool of the presented method requires development of a neural network model. For this purpose. the lecturer has accumulated sufficient number of evaluated students' papers with their answers and the grades. The neural network can be ""trained"" with the array of students' work. The more evaluated papers exist. the more accurate the results will be. The lecturer can ask the model to assess the students' papers and compare the models' grades with his own evaluations.

604,Bulgaria is one of the first countries in the world to introduce Informatics as a subject in high schools: a facultative training in programming started in several schools in the late 1960s. Later (1979). a training program in Informatics (with Logo) was launched experimentally in 27 schools. In 1981 a strategy for computer training in Bulgarian schools was adopted and as a result the first complete program for computer education in Bulgaria started in 1984. Informatics became a compulsory subject in all Bulgarian high schools in 1986. Information Technology (IT) is introduced as a separate compulsory high school subject in 1994 and later (2006) also in lower secondary schools. In 2019. students in Bulgarian schools are studying IT as a school subject from the first to the last school year. which leads to a rapid need for a substantially larger number of highly qualified teachers. Another reason that contributes to teacher shortages is that IT specialists are hired in software companies with high wages. Additionally. the dynamic development of IT itself requires modern and constantly improved methodological tools.The stakeholders in education in Bulgaria (Government. Ministry of Education and Science. universities. schools. etc.) are trying to fill this gap through a series of measures. one of which is giving the opportunity to bachelor and master engineers to become qualified teachers in IT subject.In recent years. in Burgas Free University certifying courses on IT teaching for students with engineering degrees have been introduced. During their training. these students acquire knowledge and skills in the area of teaching. The focus is on pedagogical. psychological. didactic and methodological knowledge and skills. as well as on specialized knowledge on the IT curriculum in high schools. The latter are: basic programming skills. databases. computer communications. software technologies. artificial intelligence. and others. The training of future teachers is subordinate to four main ideas: to learn to think as a teacher. to act to learn as a teacher. to learn to feel like a teacher and to learn to develop as a teacher. There are two forms in IT teachers training in Burgas Free University- one is part-time learning and the other is distance learning. In part-time learning. the trainees attend courses. but with reduced number of hours (compared to full-time students) and use digital resources as supportive materials. while in the second form - they use only the online resources for theoretical knowledge and complete the required practice hours in some of the best reputable schools. The platform containing the online training resources is Moodle. located at https://moodle.bfu.bg/.This article presents the authors' rich experience in creating and upgrading the knowledge. skills and attitude of the students in these courses. as well as to pursue professional self-improvement to develop personal qualities such as flexibility and mobility. The main emphasis is on taking into account the specifics of the training in IT. the training process. learning outcomes and the e-courses structure - text. images and interactive resources. tests and assignments. In addition. some aspects of elearning are outlined as well as several problems encountered during the training are analysed. Opportunities for improving learning outcomes. based on results and trainees' feedback have been discussed.

610,"The purpose of this study is to investigate high school English teachers' perceptions about their teaching job. The study focused on four areas, instruction. relationship with students and parents. working environment. and teaching profession. For this study. 126 English teachers from 15 different middle schools in Kyungnam province participated. and a questionnaire was used for the investigation. The findings revealed that the teachers perceived positively the effect of English class on students' English learning. and their dedication and confidence to English teaching was high. However. the teachers responded that they mainly used grammar translation method in class and viewed the lack of time for preparing their class and various limitations using learner-centered activities as the most significant problem. Also. the teachers responded that they had hard time in class because of students' demotivation and students' different English proficiency. Teachers in this study felt stressed due to the teaching load and excessive nonessential workload. It should be noted that among 126 English teachers. only 26 English teachers answered that they would be a high school English teacher if they could choose a teaching job again. In order to adequately support hight school English teachers. the factors influencing teachers' perceptions should be explored in relation to the teaching career and the size of the school.

611,We have developed the New Studio format of instruction for improved conceptual learning while retaining problem-solving skill development in large. first-year physics courses. This format retains the large lecture. but combines traditional recitation and laboratory instruction. The New Studio format integrates simplified laboratories with assigned homework problems to integrate conceptual and problem-solving skills. The studio format combines 2 hours of lecture with 4 hours of studio each week. The studio is taught for 2 hours twice per week. and consists of up to 40 students working in groups of four at tables equipped with modern instructional technology and apparatus. The group setting allows for peer instruction and development of group skills. The combination of traditional lecture with the studio format enables a research-oriented physics department with a large service teaching load to implement research-based pedagogy. Student gains on the Force Concept Inventory were similar to other courses taught by interactive engagement methods. (C) 2006 American Association of Physics Teachers.

614,James Dwight Dana (1813-1895) was one of the most prolific and influential American geologists of the nineteenth century. He also established patterns and set precedents that contributed to the establishment of the American geological and scientific communities and the possibility of pursuing geology as a career. At the same time. Dana's career was unique in several ways.The son of a New York merchant family. Dana struggled to prove that science could be a career for a man required to earn his own way in the world. In a time when federal funding for science was both controversial and relatively rare. Dana obtained a paid position with the United States South Pacific (Wilkes's) Exploring Expedition. This provided him with income. unparalleled experience literally around the globe. and. in the expedition reports. a publisher for the works that would make him a scientist of international repute.Dana moved from working on the Expedition reports to a specially created professorship at Yale. where he spent the rest of-his career. His position at Yale provided an income and a teaching load light enough for him to carry on myriad other tasks. Among these were the editorship of the American Journal of Science. authorship of numerous professional papers and teaching texts. and the maintenance of a large network of correspondence. These activities ensured his continued influence and importance in the American scientific community and allowed him to elucidate a uniquely American geology and defend it as the proper model for geologists around the world.

615,For students in Years 1-10 in Queensland. Australia. The Arts (hereafter referred to as 'arts') is one of eight Key Learning Areas in the core curriculum. Yet. while arts-comprising five strands including music is a mandatory component of the curriculum. implementation varies widely. This occurs for a range of reasons. one of which is the common practice that generalist teachers are allocated delivery of the arts programme in their teaching load. Furthermore. research reveals that music and the arts are frequently considered to be the 'frills subject' in a school's timetable. often the first to be removed from the timetable when time is short and the first to feel the impact of budget cuts. including the engagement of specialist arts educators (Russell-Bowie. 2004). This study highlights the gap between policy rhetoric for music and the arts and the pedagogical reality in generalist classrooms. Using a narrative informed case study methodology. a story constellation derived from a beginning generalist teacher and a school principal is revealed. The discussion which follows provides a focus. through the generation of key values statements derived from the data. on the tensions this beginning teacher has experienced in his practice as a teacher responsible for teaching music and the arts. juxtaposed with a similar narrative of the school principal.

616,Using data from a 2010 survey of academic chairs. this study reports on academic department chairs' recommended time allocations to new assistant professors. I contend that personal values about research and teaching influence the department chair's recommendations along with organizational characteristics. Multi-level modeling indicates that department chairs' own academic time allocations. promotion history. and desire for quality teaching as well as organizational characteristics such as research facilities. average teaching load. and research ranking influence the department chairs' advice. These results suggest that organizational characteristics do not dominate official. individual actions within the university setting as bureaucratic and neo-institutional theories might predict.

617,"The changes made in university education. by the Bologna Process. have resulted that teachers get involved in assuring that students acquire a range of capacities. during their training. In particular. the transversal capacities will be very useful for their future professional life.This change is helped by introducing the model of ""tutorial action"". During these years. it can be analysed whether the teaching staff has been involved in this tutorial and students have responded too.Unfortunately. an excessive teaching load and not being appreciated any merit for this extra work. are possible causes for the teachers' declining interest in this tutorial. Furthermore. it must be taken into account that the students' lack of interest. whom do not respond when the teacher convene them. may negatively influence the teacher.From the performance of the Tutorial Action Plan of the University of Burgos the authors of this paper. who are part of GIDUT-Teaching Innovation Group. have been surveying different aspects related to academic tutorials and transversal skills. Some of their findings have been presented in previous ICERI congresses.The methodology used makes a selection of general capacities. in various degrees offered by the University of Burgos. and it drafts questionnaires with 22 items which students must answer. In the present article. the case study is students from various training courses and two different degrees: Sciences orientation (Chemistry) and Health Sciences orientation (Science and Food Technology. SFT).The results presented. present academic year (2014/2015). are: four items related to general capacities acquired by the student and two items related to students' satisfaction with the attended tutorials. The evaluation of these results allows us to detect: the students' interest for tutorials. their knowledge about transversal capacities. just as much how important these capacities are for the students and which one is considered by as essential for their degree.In relation to tutorials. many students do not attend them and that may cause the discouragement suffered by the professors of the Faculty of Sciences. But there are some students displease with their tutors, as it was reflected in the 27{\%} of students in 3rd level of SFT who said that they did not meet in person his tutor yet. This is particularly troubling and measures shall be considered to encourage teachers to get involved in the tutorial action. to help students during their university degree.In relation to transversal competences an eye-catching result. which reflects the current society. is the students' lack of interest for the ethical-social commitment capacity. For Health Sciences. among students form 3rd and 4th course of SFT. the 16.4{\%} and 16.7{\%} respectively show that this capacity deserves just a 1 or 2. Its rating goes from 1 to 5. being 1 the lowest score. For Chemistry. Sciences orientation. students form 1st course rate this competition even worse. as a result the 27{\%} of students rate it as 1 or 2. These results shall lead us to place resources to encourage students in their ethical and social responsibility.

618,Purpose The implementation of a reformed curriculum for undergraduate medical education with a problem-oriented focus and more bedside teaching in small groups increases the academic teaching workload. The aim of this study was to investigate whether this increase in teaching duties is associated with an increase in report turnaround times of radiologists or increased unplanned absence during term times compared with term breaks (lecture-free periods) and over the whole period under investigation.Materials and Methods The database of all radiological examinations performed at a large German university hospital was retrospectively analyzed for a two-year period from the winter term 2011/12 to the summer term 2013. A total of 192 984 radiological examinations performed during this period were included in an analysis of reporting times (i.e.. time from end of examination to completion of report) during term times versus term breaks. Reporting times were analyzed for all radiological examinations and for intensive care unit (ICU) patients. In addition. radiologists' schedules were analyzed in terms of teaching duties. unplanned absence. vacation days. and days away from work for education and training.Results During the period under investigation. the teaching load increased from overall 1.75 hours/day in the winter term 2011/12 to 6.49 hours/day in the summer term 2013 and in the term break from overall 0.10 hours/day in the winter term 2011/12 to 0.71 hours/day in the summer term 2013. Reporting time increased during this period (p {\textless} 0.05) but remained shorter during term times than during term breaks. The difference between term and term break for ICU patients was not significant. There was no increase in unplanned absences during term times.Conclusion Overall. radiologists' reporting times increased during the period when the reformed curriculum for undergraduate medical education was implemented. As this was observed both during term and during term breaks. increased teaching duties alone cannot serve as a sole causal explanation.

619,"Learning to teach science out-of-field (OOF)-teaching science without the required qualifications or specializations-raises a number of challenges for teachers. This paper uses a spatial-temporal lens to examine teachers' experiences of learning to teaching science subjects OOF over time. The analysis draws on longitudinal interviews with OOF teachers to examine two research questions: (1) How do teachers' allocation to teach science-related subjects OOF change over time?, and (2) What do teachers need to learn when teaching science OOF? Over time. it became clear that there were a number of career trajectories. which were indicative of teachers' future commitment to learn to teach science. Also. various dimensions of the change processes were identified that go beyond simply learning the content and how to teach it. Five categories of learning were identified: content. teaching strategies. students and their learning. the school landscape. and the professional self. The prominence of these categories shifted overtime. Also. teachers articulated which of these learnings arose because of having to teach out-of-field. for example. making links between in-field and OOF teaching was important as these links acted like boundary objects. Implications of this study suggest that teaching science OOF should be examined spatially in the context of a teacher's full teaching load at any one time. as well as in the context of temporal career and learning trajectories. Also. research into teachers' experiences of learning to teach OOF should consider the teacher in context. and in relation to teacher learning generally. PU  - ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS.

623,Introduction/Background: The European Higher Education Area (EHEA) establishes a system of Degrees with Degree studies at its first level. whose syllabi consist of a high practical teaching load in studies of the Health Sciences branch.At our University. the Maternity Nursing subject is compulsory and is taught in year 2 of Nursing Degree studies. It aims to qualify students to pay comprehensive attention to women throughout their life cycle. and in the different stages and situations of their sexual and reproductive life (pregnancy. birth. puerperium. climaterium). to accomplish an optimum health status through prevention or recovering ill women's health. Part of this learning is given in practical seminars. Collaborative learning involves students during their own learning process. and improving their memory of the subject. their attitude towards learning. and their interpersonal relationships (intra- and intergroup). Students tend to find this interesting because it goes beyond the theoretical concepts taught in master classes. and encourages learning through peers.Thus. we consider interesting to approach and implement collaborative learning into practical seminars. and to know our students' degree of satisfaction with this practical learning and their possible improvement proposals after participating in it.Objective: To implement and bring closer collaborative learning to our Nursing Degree students for the practical seminars in the Maternity Nursing subject. and to know their degree of satisfaction and series of proposals to improve it.Method: A quanti-qualitative study about 108 year-2 Nursing Degree students registered for the Maternity Nursing subject. It included a practical seminar about the different existing family planning methods and techniques.Following the collaborative learning methodology. the students were divided into four practical groups. which were subdivided into subgroups to work on the different family planning methods and techniques. who shared their information with the other subgroups. The teacher acted as a guide for this activity and provided complementary material. After this practical seminar. students' degree of satisfaction was assessed and they indicated some improvement proposals.Results: In our study. 75.7{\%} of the students were female and 24.3{\%} were male. The mean score that the practical seminar participants gave was 8.3 points (SD +/- 0.8). Their degree of satisfaction after attending the seminar was high. One outstanding improvement proposal was to include more material resources to allow students to practice more family planning means/techniques. What the students found most interesting was the learning method employed which favoured their interaction. and the new knowledge they acquired as they can apply it as future nurses.Conclusions: Student satisfaction with the collaborative learning-based practical seminar was high. not only for the knowledge they acquired while they participated in it. but also for its dynamics and the method followed. The improvement proposals made by students allow curricular planning to improve and such activities to be performed PU  - IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION {\&} DEVELOPMENT PI  - VALENICA PA  - LAURI VOLPI 6.

Part of this learning is offered during laboratory practical session when students have the chance to analytically determine body fluids. among others. It is interesting for students as it goes beyond the theoretical concepts taught in master classes.Thus it is considered interesting to know the expectations that students have before their first practical laboratory class. their degree of satisfaction afterwards. and the improvement proposals that they consider interesting..ObjectiveTo know our Nursing Degree students' expectations before their first practical laboratory class. where technical nursing knowledge is offered. and their degree of satisfaction and a series of improvement proposals after this classMethodA quanti-qualitative study about 106 first-year Nursing Degree students faced with their first practical laboratory class as part of the Biochemistry subject. during which a series of usual nursing techniques were given (measuring parameters in blood and urine).With a questionnaire that we devised. and prior to giving the practical class. students' expectations of the practical class were evaluated. After this session. their degree of satisfaction and if their expectations were fulfilled were evaluated. Students also suggested a series of improvements. The questionnaire included closed and open (qualitative) questions. and socio-demographic data.ResultsThe mean score that students gave to the practical class before participating in it was 8.21 points (SD +/- 0.98). which rose to 9.18 points (SD +/- 0.88) after participating (p{\textless}0.001). The practical class not only equalled students' expectations. but surpassed them and their degree of satisfaction was high. One improvement proposal stood out. that of including more material resources and techniques to perform practical sessions. Students stated that the most interesting aspect for them was to undertake the techniques. whose application they considered useful for them when they are nurses in the future.ConclusionsStudents' expectations of their first practical laboratory session that centred on Nursing techniques were high. and their degree of satisfaction remained high after this session.

Our goal here is to identify drivers of the scientific production of researchers working at the ""Universidade Federal de Goias"" (UFG). a medium-to-large public Brazilian University. focusing on the effects of teaching load and supervision of graduate and undergraduate students on scientific production of faculty members. We analyzed data for 1487 faculty members of UFG. including the total number of papers published between 2011-2013. a weighted-index of scientific production and the number of publications in high-ranked journals (according to a Brazilian system of journal ranking in different areas). These variables were regressed on gender. teaching load at undergraduate and graduate levels. number of supervised undergraduate. Master and Doctoral students. self-declared amount of time dedicated to research and outreach. year of doctoral graduation. year of hiring and the scientific production before doctoral graduation. Several regression models were used to model scientific production. including ordinary least-square regression and Hurdle negative binomial models. Although there are some differences among research areas. the most important explanatory variable was the publication record of the researcher before doctoral graduation. reinforcing the role of a solid academic formation in terms of research experience. Undergraduate and graduate teaching loads were negatively and positively correlated with scientific production. respectively. However. the strength of the relationship was much higher for the second than for the first relationship. These correlates of scientific production provide guidelines for policy and management in universities. including criteria for balancing research and teaching loads. awarding fellowships and research grants. designing new policy for future hiring and creation of new graduate programs.

628,This research examines accounting faculty job search and selection in the tightening academic job market. Surveys were sent to all new accounting Ph.D.s and to faculty who relocated from 2002 to 2004. The survey included 37 factors of importance (e.g.. salary. geographical location) to new Ph.D.s in selecting their initial faculty position and to relocating faculty. Overall. faculty appear to be very concerned with their teaching load. criteria used for promotion and tenure decisions. and compatibility with other faculty. Most faculty viewed likelihood of getting tenure as very important. We note that new faculty going to doctoral schools view this item as much less important than others. The opportunity to teach desired courses was much more important for those going to non-Ph.D.-granting schools. Most faculty viewed salary as being relatively important. but those going to nondoctoral institutions viewed salary as somewhat less important than geographic location. Examination of other factors suggested significant differences between different faculty groups.

629,The objective of this paper is to present the teaching strategies for meaningful learning of the undergraduate nursing degree from the EUI Gimbernat (Ascribed to UAB) that have been incorporated into a subject in the field of nursing care in the outpatient hospital emergency room. As well. it presents the results in relation to student learning and perception of satisfaction and usefulness.The experience has been developed over the 2012-2013 courses with the participation of 143 students from 1st year of the nursing degree program.The process starts with the previous independent work of students. who have to prepare the theoretical content and answer a questionnaire to determine their level of knowledge about the topics. At the start of the sessions the teacher is responsible for energizing the group to be the students themselves and share with one another the material studied and the doubts raised and resolved between them (Flipped Classroom). During the sessions they also work on the practical skills necessary to perform procedures.Later. the students. in pairs. are addressing the resolution of a simulated emergency situation. in which they have to implement the knowledge and other skills such as teamwork and leadership.This action is filmed and shown to the group for review and evaluation by specific items (Video Feedback).The process concludes with the completion of a written individual reflection that includes the learning process experienced since the beginning of the sessions.Results are obtained in two manners. in one way. the process of learning. and in another way. student satisfaction and the usefulness of the strategies used.The student learning process is assessed quantitatively through the resulting average grade of self and co- evaluation of the recording of the simulation and the reflection of individual learning.On the other hand we estimated the satisfaction that students have shown in the results in relation to the methodology and its perceived usefulness. through the analysis of the responses generated from an online survey.It is concluded that the achievement of the stated objectives regarding the implementation of these new teaching strategies. is highly satisfactory. both in reference to the dynamics of the sessions. as in the recording emergency simulations and the subsequent self-and co-evaluation.Although some limitations are objectified in the management of the audiovisual devices and the initial teaching load is high. it is demonstrated that once the sessions are organized. the teaching load drops significantly for future editions. allowing the consideration of some very interesting teaching strategies.

Both bivariate and multivariate (regression) procedures were employed to identify factors most responsible for explaining academic pharmacist's work environment.Results: Responses were received from 177 of 600 survey recipients. Faculty reported having had accepted 10.9 +/- 13.6 papers in peer-reviewed journals during the previous 5 years. with most of those in journals with relatively low Impact Factor scores. Faculty productivity was related to type of academic institution employed. teaching effectiveness. job satisfaction. and other factors. Organizational citizenship behaviors and organizational culture was seen similarly by faculty of varied ranks and experience levels. Commitment to remain at the current college/school of pharmacy was highly associated with culture. climate. and job satisfaction conditions.Conclusions: The results provided evidence for a strong connection or nexus between teaching and research effectiveness. Organizational culture of academic pharmacy programs is highly important for faculty vitality and commitment. The findings should be helpful for academic leaders in devising programs for mentoring. development. and retention of faculty. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

631,The increasing use of English in research and higher education has been the subject of heated debate in Denmark and other European countries over the last years. This paper sets out the various positions in the national debate in Denmark. and then examines the attitudes towards these positions among the teaching staff at the country's largest university. Four topics are extracted from the debate - one which expresses a positive attitude towards English and three independent but interrelated topics which express more negative attitudes. The responses from the university lecturers show that a majority agree with all positions. negative as well as positive. This finding indicates that the attitude may not form a simple one-dimensional dichotomy. The responses are broken down according to lecturer age and the proportion of teaching the lecturer conducts in English. The results show that younger lecturers and lecturers with a higher teaching load in English are more positive towards the increase in English medium instruction.

The conclusion shows that since the college enrollment was increased in 1999. the growth ratio of the college students has been being far higher than that of the teachers. which leads to the excessive teaching load and inappropriate calculation of the teaching load towards public PE teachers. It is essential to standard the calculation method of the public PE teaching load. PU  - SCIENCE {\&} RESEARCH CENTRAL LTD PI  - NEWARK PA  - 113 BARKSDALE PROFESSIONAL CTR. NEWARK. DE 19711 USA
633,The purpose of this study was to analyze how school music teachers perceived the Quebec reform in education and how it influenced their educational practice in the classroom. Interviews were conducted with a purposeful sample of seven teachers. The most important emergent theme was the perception of a fundamental change of teacher and student roles. It was also pointed out that the reform proposes a new pedagogical model based on the development of disciplinary and transversal competencies. The main difficulties for teachers were related to the structural and organizational aspects of evaluation. the lack of time dedicated to music teaching and the teaching load per week.

634,The floor of the NY Stock Exchange. with its noise and chaos. is an apt depiction of the typical course selection meeting that many universities experience. Professors attempt to shout over their colleagues or broker deals with one another in small cabals in an attempt to garner the sections they hope to teach. When first choices fall by the wayside. quick recalculations of schedules are necessary in order to determine the next best scenario and sections to request.As inexperienced junior faculty members. the authors found this experience daunting. In response. they wrote a simple web application that allowed faculty to make their selections. and broker deals. in a calm manner over an extended time period. The application was originally written for one sub-group of about 20 faculty within the department. but its popularity quickly spread to the rest of the department and then on to other departments within the college.The Course Assignment and Reservation System (CARS) has grown steadily over the past several years in number of users. functionality. and scope. Today. faculty can plan their teaching load. work with colleagues to find mutually beneficial schedules. and easily retrieve historical information in preparation for annual reviews. promotion. or tenure appointments. Department administrators can manage course information. prepare information for certification agencies. assign faculty to courses. and monitor faculty loads. Staff and students also benefit from interfaces permitting access to appropriate information to assist them in their planning activities.

Shared curriculum has been designed and strongly connected to the intended learning outcomes (ILO's) of the programme. Blended learning was implemented to improve the efficiency of the learning process through updated technological means of instruction and to have the same curriculum with equally shared teaching load to ensure that students by the end of year I have the same competence and background. It can be noted that. at least from the perspective of academic performance. the implementation of blended learning in the shared SELECT curriculum does not have a significant impact. although local students show slightly higher grade point average (GPA).

637,Framed in the European Higher Education Area (EHEA from now on). new degree courses generally assume a greater daily monitoring of individual work of each student: more classroom exercises and academically guided activities are proposed. presence is controlled.. Although a small number of students per group would be desirable. in many cases we dealt with classes of a hundred or more students. Particularly in Spain. this new work culture has little support by society and it is difficult to propose exercises individually worked by students because the plagiarism between them (only the supervision of a teacher in classroom assure the control of learning and skills acquired for each student). Generally. the responses received from universities to these changes have been poor and low: the number of students per classroom or group remains the same as before the introduction of the European Credit. teachers usually not afford additional help in this task or even. for reasons that are irrelevant to argue. they are mostly overloaded with more teaching load. In addition. this style of work is often very different between different areas of knowledge. Therefore. the monitoring of students by the teacher becomes very difficult or even impossible and. finally. these circumstances force to adopt a style similar to the previous work. giving up this new philosophy. The new titles are merely a redistribution of credits. far from the purpose initially conceived and intended. In this paper. we present some ideas experienced in the classroom that mitigate the constraints outlined above by using new technologies.

A large scale online questionnaire was used to gather information from six public universities. The most productive role in the eyes of the academics was found to be teaching. with research and administration coming second and third. respectively. Several factors were found to be related to productivity and some of these have policy implications. The universities themselves differed markedly and research productivity was related to the amount of time available. and linked negatively to the teaching load. PU  - ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS.

639,"Based on a qualitative study. the article considers management practices at the departments of higher education institutions in the context of the recent education policy reforms in Russia. Interviews with administration of higher education institutions prove that the orientation towards productivity indicators formulated in ranking systems is the case. Interviews (over 50) with heads of departments of these higher education institutions were carried out showing that the ""new managerialist"" policy does not comply to the existing practices of regulating academic work based on collegiality and informal redistribution of work. The main reason for this is the jobs which are not covered by contracts and therefore not paid. As a result. the amount of such jobs is only increasing administrative work. bureaucratic load (""paper work""). methodical support of teaching. In particular. heads of departments are regulating reproduction of the status systems of the departments they head. These informal mechanisms help to adapt to the increasing workload in supportive functions: the heads of departments regulate distribution of extra work informally. The understanding of quality in work is adapted to the demands of the departments promoting collegiality. reciprocity. rather than competition. The role of heads of departments in such circumstances becomes peculiar. On the one hand. administrative. bureaucratic and teaching load of heads of departments is growing. On the other hand. they are expected to increase their research productivity.

641,"Learning-focussed educational models require the development of pedagogical. methodological. assessment and technological competences among the faculty community. The COVID-19 pandemic has accentuated the need for this training. This study evaluates the impact of the training project ""Educate to Transform"" on teacher attitudes. knowledge and on the implementation of innovative teaching methodologies. There were 695 faculty participants in the program conducted at the Universidad Francisco de Vitoria (UFV). Participants included full-time professors (FULL-PROF) and part-time professors (PART-PROF). The measurement instrument was validated using the entire sample and a subsample of 357 participants was used to analyse the impact of the program (pre and post measurement). Professor attitudes and knowledge of or familiarity with innovative methodologies and their application in the classroom were evaluated. The findings show that the program improved the attitudes of teachers towards innovation. raised the level of awareness and number of methodologies implemented in the classroom. The methodology towards more experiential and collaborative learning is effective in transforming teaching practice. Furthermore. the implementation of the program through the CANVAS platform. making teachers live the experience as learners. seems to have contributed to improve the teachers' attitude towards the LMS. The only difference found among the participants was a worse attitude towards innovation on the part of medical teachers. with a clearly differentiated profile of teachers and students. as well as a greater implementation of active methodologies by teachers with a lower teaching load.

Consequently. a measure for the rate of adaption of teaching materials and methods per lecturer was constructed and a linear regression model employed to discuss the determinants of this adaption.The results show the following: Understanding online teaching as a permanent solution for the future. the extent of an individual's teaching load and a tenured employment were identified as significant influences fostering the adaption of teaching methods and materials to the online context.

643,Undergraduate research allows faculty mentors to collaborate with students in order to make an original or creative contribution to a particular discipline. Traditional undergraduate research is often driven by a research question related to the mentor's research program or developed by the student. Students perform a background search on the subject. develop a hypothesis. collect experimental data. and then submit a manuscript for publication or an abstract describing a completed project. Advancing cognitive and intellectual growth of the students and increasing job satisfaction and professional development of the faculty mentors are some of the benefits of undergraduate research.Implementation of traditional undergraduate research programs at primarily teaching colleges presents several challenges. These include the requirement to carry a full teaching load that limits the time devoted to research for students' mentors. the lack of funds allocated to research. the limited grant writing assistance. and the deficient laboratory technical assistance and facilities. In addition to these challenges. undergraduate research is difficult to assess or to integrate within an established curriculum.In this report we describe the development of a modular. learning objective-driven research course in biotechnology as part of an undergraduate biology minor. The research course described in this pilot study is currently being evaluated by the instructor using descriptive rubrics and take-home exams. Its assessment also takes into consideration the students' perspective using institutional course evaluations. on-going group discussions. and surveys of course learning gains. Based on our preliminary results. this type of undergraduate research experience has several advantages over traditional undergraduate research. One of these advantages is the higher emphasis on the learning and skill development involved in the research process. as opposed to traditionally emphasizing the success of the experiment. or its data collection and dissemination. Another advantage is the lower requirement of funds and time to implement as compared to a traditional undergraduate research experience.Based on students' feedback. this course allows students to appreciate all the different aspects of the biotechnology research process including troubleshooting when experiments do not work as expected. gaining practice in the use of lab instrumentation not used in regular courses. designing of experiments by using cheaper and faster methods. critically evaluating specialized scientific literature and obtaining and disseminating original results worth of publication. The students also learn how to communicate or summarize their own thought processes. procedures and results with clarity by breaking down the information and presenting it with a simpler language.The results of this pilot study suggest that the careful implementation of undergraduate research courses driven by the assessment of learning objectives and based on a faculty research program may be a good method to integrate biotechnology research into the curriculum of primarily teaching institutions.

648,Background: Nursing and midwifery education have comparatively recently moved into academia in Ireland. In 2002. nurse tutors who were qualified to Master's degree level assimilated into the third-level sector. Only 11 of the 35 staff (31{\%}) in one university School held. or were undertaking. a PhD. In 2006. children's nursing and midwifery tutors also moved into third-level institutions. The culture of all assimilating tutors was focussed on teaching. rather than research.Objectives: The School set ambitious plans to develop the research abilities of all academics. setting the goal that 75{\%} of academic staff would either hold. or be undertaking. a PhD by 2010. Objectives were also set to increase external research funding. peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations.Methods: A combination of sabbatical leaves. student stipends and periods of reduced teaching load was introduced to provide staff with protected time for doctoral studies. Funding for conference and research expenses was provided. based on the previous year's research output of publications. conference presentations and external funding submissions.Results: By October 2010. 79{\%} of the 66 School staff either had (n = 23). or were conducting (n = 29).

649,Literature indicates that the academic work role and. by implication. academics suffer tremendous pressure and that this role will probably be difficult to maintain and sustain in future. This is the result of numerous external and internal influences within and outside of higher education. The internal and external aspects impacting on higher education should. however not be regarded in isolation. since there is a systemic interdependence between these aspects which collectively form and dominate the current higher education environment.External aspects which currently influence the academic work role and will continue to do so in future. include globalisation and the increased application of advanced information technology and technology within all aspects of higher education. Literature also indicates a shift in higher education from institutions that were primarily the domain of the elite to institutions that strive to admit a greater variety and larger numbers of students who do not necessarily possess the required academic foundation. The increasing competition among institutions in order to ensure survival and financial sustainability contributes to the fact that - like all other organisations - higher education institutions (and by implication academics) continually have to pay attention to the changing needs and requirements of their primary clients. namely the labour sector students. and governments. Maintaining and ensuring ongoing quality are currently high on the agenda of higher education and most higher education institutions. Implementing and ensuring quality in higher education institutions relate to and address all aspects of higher education. including curriculum development. teaching and research - all of which must be managed by academics.The academic work role is. however not only influenced by external realities. but also by various internal realities. One of the primary aims of any higher education institution is making available and establishing high quality teaching and learning experiences for its students. Academic staff members are primarily responsible for establishing and managing these aspects and learning environments. However the way in which teaching and learning takes place is influenced by numerous aspects. including higher student numbers as a result of among other things. greater accessibility and the incorporation of technology (as previously mentioned). Literature indicates that research. which is one of the core tasks of any academic. may be under pressure as a result of among other things. the absence of resources and structures. In addition academics complain about a lack of time to do research because other tasks have to be undertaken concurrently. Yet research is regarded as the most important criterion whereby academics obtain stature and promotion. In addition to teaching and research responsibilities. the work pressure of academics is increased due to further responsibilities in the form of increased community service. and administration and entrepreneurial activities. Although administrative responsibilities form apart of the non-core activities of academics. they require additional time and inputs in an already complex work environment.In order to address the preceding dilemmas resulting from the internal and external realities. part-time teaching staff members are appointed to decrease the teaching load of full-time appointed academic personnel. Although temporary teaching staff members are utilised. full-time academics still bear the supervisory responsibilities and carry the administrative load associated with this type of appointment by higher education institutions.Higher education institutions - more so than any other organisation - depend on the intellectual abilities and the commitment of academic staff. The intellectual and creative abilities of this group largely determine the existence and sustainability of higher education institutions. The preceding changes and re

The research method used is a survey of three categories of experts from 9 universities of Almaty (researchers. technology transfer managers. spin-off-owners). Despite the strong efforts of the government of Kazakhstan in building innovation infrastructure. there is a low level of innovation activity. less than 5{\%} of university inventions are transferred into the industry. The results of the expert survey showed that the main barriers for cooperation between university and industry are: lack of resources to build university-industry links. lack of time due to high teaching load. poor qualification of technology transfer managers and lack of networking with industry. Based on the results of the expert survey. it is proposed to develop the ecosystem for the commercialization of university-based technologies. for which the following economic activities are important: human resources. financing. intellectual property management system. and intermediary infrastructure.

653,"There is no doubt that the characteristics of the pedagogical community influence the quality of school education: its problems are often associated with the effectiveness of teachers training and their professional growth. On the other hand. the quality of the school environment and the conditions of pedagogical work are important factors for both the positive education of schoolchildren and its real results. In this perspective. the effectiveness of the education system becomes apparent in comparison with similar systems. That is why the data of international empirical studies aimed at studying the quality of education today are extremely important both for the country as a whole and for its different regions. To take measures for the development of the pedagogical community of the Kirov region. we made a comprehensive analysis of the teaching staff of the regional pedagogical community. The concept is based on materials from the third international study Teaching and Learning International Survey (TALIS 2018). The purpose of this article is to compare the qualities of regional school teachers and their pedagogical practice with similar indicators in foreign countries. The author of the article. on the grounds of the comparison of working conditions. professional education and development of teachers. justifies the need for administrative decisions in personnel policy. The leading research methods here are the collection of data. obtained by questioning in maintaining feedback from teachers. analyzing the conditions of pedagogical practices. modeling and statistical processing of research results. As a result of a study conducted in 2018-2019. in which 1025 teachers of secondary schools from the Kirov region took part. the author of the article found: teachers spend. on the average. 44 astronomical hours per week to perform their duties. besides it takes urban teachers 4 hours more to make their work as compared with rural teachers, the teaching load of the younger age group teachers is 1.5 times greater than that of the older age group teachers, foreign teachers spend 6 hours a week less to perform their official duties in comparison with teachers of the Kirov region, teachers spend most of their time on individual planning. preparing for lessons. and on general administrative work. while participating in extracurricular activities and communicating with parents takes the least amount of time in the structure of official duties. The professional knowledge of teachers acquired in the process of their education is estimated below the average level from the level of full preparedness to perform their professional duties, every fifth educator notes a high interest in learning the technologies of individual teaching. teaching children with special needs and class supervision issues. The theoretical significance of the article is due to its contribution to the development of scientific ideas about the quality of school teachers in comparison with the national educational systems of other countries. Practical use of the research results allows us to build a trajectory of work with pedagogical staff based on working out and implementing a set of measures for the development of the pedagogical community of the regional educational system.

654,"Examining mathematics performance in the PISA 2003 survey in Iceland reveals that higher performance was reached in large schools than in small schools (Kristin Bjarnadottir. 2008). This was also the case in Denmark (Egelund. 2006). Mathematics was again in the focus of PISA 2012. in which most 15-year old students in Iceland participated. When the test results were revealed in December 2013. the Icelandic testing institute was asked to divide the schools into four categories: 1-10. 11-25. 26-40 and 41-128 participating students. The numbers of schools were 36. 39. 34 and 25 respectively. The corresponding numbers of students were 192. 658. 1122 and 1537 (see Tafla 1). The results in the category of largest number of students participating in PISA 2012 were again significantly better than in other school-sizes. 504 points on average against 493 points in Iceland as a whole. and only 481 points on average in schools of 11-25 participants (see Mynd 3. Mynd 4 and Tafla 4).A questionnaire was sent to mathematics teachers in 10 schools in each of the three categories with the largest number of participants. leaving out the smallest schools. as individual school results in that category were not available from PISA 2003.

The corresponding numbers of participants in the chosen schools were 721. 303 and 174 respectively (see Tafla 1).The questions asked of the teachers concerned their education, their experience as mathematics teachers, their experience in teaching the group participating in PISA 2012, the proportion of mathematics teaching in their teaching assignments at the time of the survey and earlier, the textbooks they used for the PISA 2012 participants, and finally they were asked if the first upper secondary school mathematics course was an option for their students.The results did not reveal much difference in the teachers' educational background. Teachers in all categories had diverse backgrounds, the average age in each category was 48. 50 and 42 years respectively (see Tafla 3). and the majority had specialized in mathematics education through different kinds of work or degrees (see Tafla 5).Nearly all teachers in the school-group with 41-128 participants had taught the PISA 2012 participants during the academic year in question. the preceding year and many also two years earlier. but not always the same students (see Tafla 6). Thus they were closely familiar with the students as well as the teaching material that led up to PISA 2012. Many of them taught multiple sections of the same class. They therefore had more opportunities to reflect upon their teaching and reconsider their methods during the repetition than other teachers. Teachers in schools with 11-25 participating students were clearly less experienced in this area.The majority of schools in all categories could offer their students opportunities to take the first upper secondary school mathematics course (see Tafla 9). According to Shulman's (1986) theories. teachers' curriculum knowledge is important. in particular familiarity with the topics and issues that have been and will be taught in the same subject area during the preceding and later years in school. and the materials that embody them. No significant difference in the use of the two textbook series available was detected (see Tafla 10).Tafla 7 informs that the proportion of mathematics in the teaching load is highest among teachers in the largest schools. which supports Egelund's (2006) hypothesis that teachers in the largest schools have the greatest opportunities to teach the subject they are best prepared for. Furthermore. one may agree with Egelund's hypothesis that large schools offer the best possibilities of teachers' collaboration and team meetings concerning a subject are"
655,Purpose. To describe the utility of school-wide use of mission-based reporting (MBR) for medical school deans and department chairs.Method. All faculty members in the University of California. Davis. School of Medicine reported their clinical. creative. teaching. and service activities for 2000-2001 to the MBR system. The authors report on school-wide and department MBR profiles. and profiles by rank and academic series. They validate MBR by comparing individual results with actual merit actions reviewed independently by the school's academic personnel 0 committee.Results. A total of 419 faculty members (85{\%}) completed their MBR reports. The average faculty member spent considerably more than 50 hours per week fulfilling the missions of the school. and full professors and faculty members in academic series supported by state funds were the most productive in investigative and creative work. The teaching load was shared equally by all the academic ranks. although the clinician-scholars taught more than did faculty members in the other series. There was an inverse relationship between clinical load and academic rank. with the majority of the clinical work performed by junior faculty members. MBR results compared favorably with the merit review process. although MBR is not expected to replace the traditional peer review system.Conclusion. The creation of these graphic profiles and summaries is a valuable feature of MBR that would not have been possible without such quantitative data. The profiles allow monitoring to ensure that workload conforms to established objectives for individuals. departments. academic ranks and series. Finally. the authors discuss future directions for their MBR system. PU  - LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS {\&} WILKINS PI  - PHILADELPHIA PA  - TWO COMMERCE SQ. 2001 MARKET ST. PHILADELPHIA. PA 19103 USA
656,One of the main challenges facing primary mainstream teachers in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) stems from the current educational movement towards inclusion. It is an international phenomenon. a process that emphasizes providing special education services to students with special educational needs within the regular classrooms. The purpose of the study was to identify perceptions about educating students with special educational needs in the mainstream education setting. The researchers examined the issue of inclusive education and the attitudes towards inclusion among the primary mainstream teachers in Dubai in the large private sector. The study was also designed to identify whether these teachers perceived themselves capable of adapting to what inclusion requires.The study relied on qualitative methods. Questionnaires were given to primary mainstream teachers working in two large private schools in Dubai. Additionally teachers were interviewed too. All teachers involved in the study are expatriates. An analysis of data collected indicated that primary mainstream teachers in Dubai in the private sector favour traditional special education service delivery models over full inclusive practices. These teachers felt students with special educational needs lack skills needed to master the mainstream regular classroom course content. The teachers also expressed that the heavy teaching load in the mainstream classroom makes it hard to meet the needs of students with special educational needs in the private sector. However. results also indicated that teachers perceive additional training. support from administrators. and access to related services and resources as necessary in order to meet the needs of their students with special educational needs in the mainstream education setting. The study ended with research based recommendations for future practice. PU  - Sped Sp Zoo PI  - Bielsko-Biala PA  - Legionow 6. Bielsko-Biala. POLAND
657,"The problem under study is current and relevant due to the contradiction between the understanding of the need to digitalize the educational process. to overcome the ""digital gap"" in the student-teacher relationship. and the lack of an effective method for improving the skills of the teaching staff that allows them to organize their professional activities using digital technologies.The teaching load of the university teacher. the variety of digital technologies and methods of their use in the educational process do not allow to organize advanced training courses in a mode parallel to the main educational process of the university and in isolation from the electronic information and education environment of the institution.In this regard. this article is aimed at testing the hypothesis that the successful digitalization of the educational process in a separate educational institution is facilitated by mass training courses organized with direct immersion of participants in the digital environment.The leading method of studying this problem was a pedagogical experiment conducted among university teachers and students. which allowed us to identify a positive trend in the readiness of teachers to use the possibilities of the electronic information and education environment of the university based on the results of the proposed method.

The constituents of the quality management system of educational activity are considered. The subsystems of the automated control system of educational activity of the university have been characterised and analysed. The key elements of the information systems use dare the following electronic databases: students and their academic performance, results of employment, students' satisfaction with educational programs, distribution of the teaching load, teachers' performance, learning and teaching resources. facilities. equipment and their cost, other indicators of university activity. In addition to the popular application packages. such as ""iZETA"". ""The System of Financially-Oriented Management of Higher Education Institutions"". and ""Anti-Plagiarism"". the software products developed by KNUTD are described. Namely. the ""Schedule"" package allows one to form directories focused on the drawing up of class schedules which are accessible to all divisions. The software ""Electronic Journal"" provides monitoring of learning outcomes and prompt response to the failure of individual students, it serves for the formation of final control mark sheets. the evaluation of academic success rates of university students. etc. The electronic rating system ""RTS rating"" is used for the evaluation of research and teaching staff activity according to the results of their work in the reported year. The modular environment of the University's educational process. based on the Moodle distance learning platform. is described. It accumulates the teaching and methodological support necessary for conducting educational activities. The results of the research are of practical value since the implementation of the considered software products is capable of improving the quality and effectiveness of the management of educational activities of higher education institutions.

659,"The Public Management and Administration (PMA - in Spanish ""Gestion y Administracion Publica"". GAP) degree at the Universitat Jaume I (UJI) will close the first four years cycle in the next academic year (2011-2012 to 2015-2016). Graduates in PMA have many and varied career expectative. ranging from the local administration until European and international administration. or both the public and private sector. The PMA degree was designed according the Bologna degree structure adapted for Spain by a statute law: 4 + 1, four years or 240 European Credit Transfer System (ECTS) credits (60 cr/y) assigned to the degree. and one year or 60 ECTS credits assigned to the master.Recently. the Ministry of Education issued a regulatory law (National Official Newsletter - BOE- 2015, 29. Feb 3: 8088- 8091, http://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2015/02/03/pdfs/BOE-A-2015-943.pdf) for organising the university studies in a different structure according the rest of Bologna studies in Europe: 3 + 2, three years or 180 European Credit Transfer System (ECTS) credits (60 cr/y) assigned to the degree. and two years or 120 ECTS credits assigned to the master. Essentially. this law corrects the great mistake the then executive did more than ten years ago imposing longer degrees than the rest of the Bologna territory. But. really. creates a new problem because merely abolish the 4+1 structure for new and existing degrees. and. in addition. it has to be applied since the new academic year 2015-2016. just when the existing educational surveillance authorities finish their own organisation revision. Other problem is not all degrees have created a ""natural"" continuity in related masters. At Spain. since a degree or master is posed to the university authorities. until it starts to run. it may take more than two years. and every study is officially reviewed (by the educational surveillance authorities) every six years. General speaking. the environment of the Bologna studies could be characterised by a parameter representing the total time spent by students to reach a master degree. and it is set as invariant of five years in the expression n1 + n2 = 5. when n1 = 1.... 4 and n2 = 1.... 4 (some specific studies. as Medicine. are excluded because they are longer). Therefore. we cannot dismiss that next Spanish executives issue new regulatory laws setting studies' curricula as '1+4'. '2+3' too. or (come back to) 4+1 structures.This is a new challenge for the PMA degree in its fourth year: to move or not to the new 3+2 curriculum design. despite it is not yet consolidated. But some questions must be answered and a bunch of tethers should be released before entering in the formal process to create a new 3 years PMA degree and the corresponding 2 years master. The main questions are the following: (1) Could be more interesting for prospective students make a degree of three years instead of four years?, (2) What master or masters' catalogue UJI could offer as a continuation of the ""+2""?, (3) How has to change the financial system in public universities to face the re-structuration and compete against private universities?, (4) How can. UJI and departments. manage the teaching load loss related to the migration from ""4+"" to ""3+"". and the consequent wide reorganization of official teaching assignments? The aim of this work is to reflect on these issues and try to find approximate answers based on our current and past educational and academic experience.

660,The implementation of undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in Spanish universities has been accompanied by a review of the teaching methodologies used. These methodologies incorporating. in many cases. new Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). The ICT of Audience Response Systems (ARS). Clickers. and videos (mUVies) were used in a quantitative subject of a degree offered by the Universitat de Valencia (UV). in an attempt to mitigate the low teaching load of the same and provide students with support material inside and outside the classroom. The work presented examines the students' perception of the use of these ICTs in their learning process and also the volume of work involved in its implementation. Using descriptive and inferential analyses of the opinions obtained in the ICT surveys and the results of the continuous assessment and the final exam. we conclude that the students valued the use of both ICTs very positively with average score higher than 8 (out of 10). rating better the mUVies than Clickers. As for the volume of work that the implementation of ICTs. this is estimated at about 7.5 hours for students and about 132.5 hours for teachers. PU  - UNIV VALENCIA.

Research productivity is a very relevant factor in explaining job satisfaction in academics in different stages of their career. Interesting differences across graduation cohorts are found as regards the impact of research productivity and other satisfaction drivers. such as other research outcomes - research stays abroad and cooperation with teams abroad - and teaching load. marital status and young children. Higher education institutions aiming to foster productivity and stability in their academic staff should adapt their incentive systems to the preferences and concerns of this particular type of worker and promote their internal motivation.

662,Since 1997. the Korean Ministry of Education (MOE) has been implementing a primary school English program for the 3rd to the 6th grader as part of its globalization effort. After ten years of implementation. this program has been criticized for a lack of continuity between the primary and secondary school English curriculum. This problem is largely ascribed to the insufficient instructional hours for English classes offered in primary schools. Under the current system. 3rd and 4th graders take English classes once a week while 5th and 6th graders receive two classes per week. Accordingly. the MOE has piloted a new program to increase the number of instructional hours of primary school English classes. The present study surveyed 306 classroom teachers and 685 students who have participated in this pilot program to examine the positive and negative aspects of the new initiative. The findings show that while the participants felt that there was a clear need for increased instructional hours. they pointed out several barriers to quickly adopting the program. The main barriers to implementing the program were increased teaching load and a lack of highly qualified teachers. PU  - Korea Association Of Teachers Of English
663,In medical studies. pharmacology is a subject with a high teaching and study load. The COVID-19 pandemic-related switch to distance learning implies challenges for students and teachers. To identify changes of behavior. attitudes. and needs among students and teachers in clinical pharmacology during the pandemic. regular surveys were conducted at Ulm University. Germany. Overall. 884 students and 5 teachers answered the survey. Over time. students' usage of learning materials in print form and further literature (textbooks. guidelines) constantly decreased. In turn. most students used digital materials provided via a learning management system. Attitudes and opinions of students and teachers significantly differed regarding (i) the benefit of certain teaching formats and learning materials. (ii) open-mindedness towards e-learning. and (iii) future visions. Most students and lecturers stated that they spent more time on study or teaching-related activities. respectively. and had less contact with fellow students or colleagues in comparison to pre-pandemic times. Furthermore. the subjective teaching load for most lecturers (80{\%}) increased during the pandemic. To identify determinants of learning success. the survey data were correlated with students' gradings in the written exams of clinical pharmacology. In the first online semester (summer term 2020). the use of paper-based learning scripts was correlated with better exam grades. No correlation with grade was found for any other learning materials. Age was inversely correlated with exam grading. Striking a balance between the future visions and needs of students and teachers implies a particular challenge for the educational system of the next years.

664,The recent modernization of the higher education system in Russia developed a network of universities with special status and financial support. Such universities have become centers of attraction for young people from different regions of the Russian Federation. The focus of this study. however. is on how the universities that do not enjoy such a special status maintain and attract enrollment in such a context. More specifically. the study focuses on the social practices that underpin the process of such enrollment and utilizes the methodological framework for the study of social practices developed by Zaslayskaya.The study reveals that these universities face problems both with the quality and quantity of applicants. They spontaneously adapt to this situation by recruiting applicants to publicly and privately funded places in order to solve their internal contradictory problems - on one hand. to maintain enrollment in order to preserve an educational program and the teaching load of instructors. while. on the other. complying with regulatory requirements regarding the selection of applicants and the level of their further training. The violation of these requirements can have extremely negative consequences for universities.By analyzing normative documents. the study further reveals how these practices were formed to ensure the survival of universities. The author argues that existing practices distort competitive selection and create institutional obstacles to the modernization of regional economics by having a detrimental effect on regional human capital. These practices are. in part. of non-legal nature. because they are often accompanied by violations of regulatory requirements and moral obligations of universities to provide quality higher education. The article concludes. however. that the identified practices are not local. They are rooted differentially across Russian universities depending on their status. the competitive potential of universities and where universities operate. Finally. the author elaborates on solutions to transform existing practices in accordance with the goals of regional higher education systems.

In an 8-week period in the summer of 1993. 18 students completed the requirements for Year I of the 4-year baccalaureate nursing programme. When compared to their generic counterparts. these 'fast-trackers' were found to be older. more likely to be part-time and. at the end of Year 2 were academically equivalent. Students in the programme were highly enthusiastic. citing the benefits of saving a year of student costs and of entering the profession a year earlier. Faculty involved with the programme were positive about the benefits for students. although a drawback for full-time faculty was the impact of a heavy summer teaching load on other scholarly activities. Because of the programme's success. consideration now being given to extending the fast-track option beyond Year I. PU  - CHURCHILL LIVINGSTONE PI  - EDINBURGH PA  - JOURNAL PRODUCTION DEPT.

'teaching duty allocation' and 'non-human factors') were examined. 135 schools and 94 teachers were surveyed. 81{\%} teachers were male and 85{\%} were under 40. About half of the respondents were trained in sport science and had 1-2 years teaching experience. Over 90{\%} of teachers perceived they have knowledge to teach and can manage students. However. 80{\%} felt they need more exposure and training. Male teachers were better than female teachers in managing students and conducting activities/ experiments. Experienced teachers were better in conducting activities and experiments. Teachers majoring in sport science were more knowledgeable while PE majors found teaching sport science challenging. Most teachers perceived that teaching facilities. financial allocation and reference resources were inadequate. Majority of the administrators consulted teachers before assigning teaching load but failed to observe teaching. This research provides invaluable feedbacks on the implementation of the programme.

669,In recent years. China's economic strength has been developing rapidly. At the same time. people's daily living standards have also been increasingly rising. In this context. the authorities are paying more and more attention to the training of students as well as talents. As a result. the quality of classroom teaching in universities has become a major concern. As an essential evaluation tool for teaching quality. evaluation of classroom teaching has been widely recognised and implemented. With the rapid development of computer technology and information technology. teaching evaluation based on various algorithms has been widely used. thus becoming an increasingly important teaching evaluation method. Thus. classroom teaching assessment has become one of the hot issues discussed in the field of education both at home and abroad. A great number of universities are now fully aware that the effectiveness of teachers is central to their survival and development and can have a direct impact on the training of students. The criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of teaching are highly subjective. but at the same time. there is a considerable degree of objectivity. As a result. the application of more scientific methods and computational data can make the results of classroom assessment more reliable. However. there is a lack of reliable reference data for evaluating the quality of classroom teaching in higher education. In addition. it is difficult to develop an evaluation data management and evaluation management model based on multiple data sources. which may cause a negative effect on the impartiality and objectivity of evaluation results. What is worse. many teachers do not have enough time to interact with their students. After all. most teachers in universities now have a heavy teaching load. and much of their time is spent on lesson preparation. Hence. they usually lack active interaction with their students. In the current education system. the objectives of higher education are mainly test-taking. and practical application is lacking. Therefore. based on the existing teaching basis. how to improve the effectiveness of university classroom teaching and improve the overall quality of students on the basis of test-taking objectives will be a key issue in teaching research. In order to solve this problem. this paper mainly researches the evaluation of classroom teaching quality in universities based on the interval intuitionistic fuzzy theory. This study is based on a detailed analysis of the needs of teaching quality assessment management. in terms of comprehensiveness of assessment and data sources. Then. the teaching evaluation system is designed and developed based on an analysis of the roles of students and teachers. This system can be applied to speed up the efficiency and fairness of teaching evaluation in universities. thereby greatly improving the management of teaching in universities.

Using data from six cohorts of students at a UC campus. we examine the impact of initial course-taking with three distinct types of instructors-tenure-track research faculty. tenure-track teaching faculty. and contingent lecturers-on students' current and subsequent academic outcomes. Descriptive analyses indicate that tenure-track teaching faculty assume a substantially larger teaching load than either research faculty or lecturers. Using a three-way fixed effects model. we find limited evidence supporting differences by faculty type on either current or downstream student outcomes.

672,Innovative solutions are called for to deal with the increasingly heavy burdens placed on teaching staff in German universities by even higher numbers of student enrolments. Alongside differentiating between research and teaching tenures. as recommended by the German Council of Science and Humanities (Wissenschaftsrat). there is also a series of other options for meeting the challenges. One of these which has proven its value is partial outsourcing of the teaching load to external academic staff provided by a specialised service provider. Such a professionalised approach to teaching leads to a high degree of unity between research and teaching activities. whilst the wide scope for research activities allows to stop the drift of university staff engaged in research into pure institutes of research. meaning that they continue to contribute their expertise to ensure high standards in university teaching.

Program characteristics were examined in relation to the school demographic characteristics of enrollment. percentage of minority students. and percentage of students receiving free lunch. Indiana public school districts (N=98) were randomly selected (sampling rate=33{\%}). Response rate by school corporation was 100{\%} and final response rate for the total sample of music teachers was 63.1 {\%} (N=391). Data were gathered by means of a survey. Teachers provided information concerning (a) music curricular offerings by area and grade level, (b) teaching load and instructional contact time, and. (c) class enrollments and performance activities. For each school district sampled. archival data were obtained from the State Department of Education and the Indiana State School Music Association. Among the results. wide variability was found in program characteristics. enrollment. participation rate. and performance activity. Approximately 64{\%} of the sample indicated general music as at least part of their teaching load. Teaching load was significantly correlated with time allocations for five of seven instructional activities in general music. Median student participation rates in music at the secondary level varied from 6 {\%} (strings) to 17{\%} (band) to 24{\%} (choral). Percentages for students on free lunch and minority students were generally not correlated with other variables. including participation rates. School and ensemble enrollments and amount of instructional time were generally not correlated with numbers of performances. String programs were reported for approximately 16{\%} of the sample school corporations and those that offered strings had larger school enrollments than those not offering strings.

674,Over the past 25 years. the Australian workforce has become more casualised. with approximately one-quarter of the workforce in casual employment today. One of the highest users of casual employees is the higher education sector. where casual academics (referred to as sessionals in the Australian context) are estimated to account for 50{\%} of the overall teaching load. The purpose of this article is to investigate the processes associated with the management of sessional academic staff. The study focuses on a single university. utilising a survey questionnaire and interviews with the sessional academics and their managers. The results depict a bifurcated system of maximum labour regulation for full-time academics alongside minimum regulation for sessional staff. The findings stress the urgency for improvement in both the employment conditions and management of sessional academic staff. both for their own benefit and the universities that employ them.

675,An original cross-sectional dataset referring to a medium-sized Italian university is implemented in order to analyze the determinants of scientific research production at individual level. The dataset includes 942 permanent researchers of various scientific sectors for a 3-year time-span (2008-2010). Three different indicators-based on the number of publications and/or citations-are considered as response variables. The corresponding distributions are highly skewed and display an excess of zero-valued observations. In this setting. the goodness-of-fit of several Poisson mixture regression models are explored by assuming an extensive set of explanatory variables. As to the personal observable characteristics of the researchers. the results emphasize the age effect and the gender productivity gap-as previously documented by existing studies. Analogously. the analysis confirms that productivity is strongly affected by the publication and citation practices adopted in different scientific disciplines. The empirical evidence on the connection between teaching and research activities suggests that no univocal substitution or complementarity thesis can be claimed: a major teaching load does not affect the odds to be a non-active researcher and does not significantly reduce the number of publications for active researchers. In addition. new evidence emerges on the effect of researchers administrative tasks-which seem to be negatively related with researcher's productivity-and on the composition of departments. Researchers' productivity is apparently enhanced by operating in department filled with more administrative and technical staff. and it is not significantly affected by the composition of the department in terms of senior/junior researchers.

676,Background: The heel is the prominence at the posterior end of the foot. It is based on the projection of one bone. the calcaneus or heel bone. behind the articulation of the bones of the lower leg. Foot pain is not rare finding in the general population. particularly in older adults. The prevalence in adults ages {\textgreater}= 18 year's ranges from 17 to 24{\%}. Heel pain is a general term used to describe pain and discomfort felt anywhere in or around the rear of the foot. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of heel and foot pain and their determinants among teachers in Abha sector. Methodology: A deceptive cross-sectional approach was applied for the current research. All accessible teachers working in governmental and private schools in Abha sector. To be included. teachers should be teaching but not in administrative positions. free of musculoskeletal disorders due to causes other than teaching. Teachers with foot congenital anomalies. newly employed teachers. A self-administered questionnaire was personally distributed to included school teachers in Abha sector.

677,Faculty members are increasingly recognizing the value of integrating high impact practices. such as undergraduate research. into the college experience. In this paper. I argue that one way of getting undergraduate students involved in political science research is to develop undergraduate research labs. wherein a small group of undergraduate students works collaboratively with a faculty member to carry out the research process from start to finish. I focus on how to develop and operate research labs at small to mid-sized institutions. I provide an overview of how I organized and conducted an undergraduate research lab and illustrate how the lab worked by describing a project that my lab recently carried out. I also describe how political science research labs can benefit students and political science programs. I end by reflecting on what I learned along the way. which I hope will be helpful to others who are considering developing similar experiences. Overall. I encourage other political scientists to develop undergraduate research labs but argue that. given the high teaching loads at many institutions. faculty should operate research labs as classes so that they count as part of one's teaching load.

678,The entrance of Spanish University System in the European Higher Education Area (EHEA) has brought with it a number of changes and challenges for teachers. These include the establishment of a common credit system that allows comparison between qualifications and promote student mobility. Adapting Spanish credits systems to the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS) has revolutionized both teachers and students as the system passes to count every credit hours taught by the teacher in hours of student work. The change in the definition in the workload has been significant. It has gone from a measure on the teaching load of a teacher evaluation unit volume of student work. This change also results in a change in the angle of vision of our education system going from teaching focus to student-learning focus. Also. among its EHEA objectives arises the challenge of ensuring quality in higher education with comparable criteria and methodologies. Given these challenges. we believe collaboration among different disciplines is necessary when defining and implementing new teaching methods or approaches. and their subsequent evaluation and verification of students' results. Hence the idea of designing a study. starting from the Faculty of Education. in order to discuss these requirements in relation to assessment and methodological aspects in different degrees. This paper presents the initial stages of planning and design of the study developed in several degrees from the University of Cantabria.

680,"Introduction. In the context of fundamental changes which have occurred in the last decades in the world of professions and transition from mono-professionalism to poly-professionalism. a modern man needs to have an ability to freely navigate the modern labour market. to quickly diversify contents and quality of the professional activity. and. if thought appropriate. to change an occupation without difficulty. Nowadays. the requirements for the teachers of vocational training are designed in a completely different way to provide high-quality lifelong learning.The aim of the research is to reveal the psychological readiness of teachers of vocational school for the development of new types of learning activities in the conditions of a professional reorientation.Methodology and research methods. The methodological framework of the present research is based on conceptual provisions of the personal-focused. subject. competency-based and system approaches to vocational education. as well as theories of the psychology of abilities and organization of continuing the professional education of adults. General scientific methods such as analysis. synthesis. specification and generalization were applied. Techniques of psychological and pedagogical observation and questionnaire were used at the diagnostic phase of the study as the leading ones.Results and scientific novelty. The concepts of ""professionalization"". ""professional self-determination"". ""transprofessional competencies"" and ""psycho-pedagogical assistance"" are clarified. It is stated that under the increasingly complex socio-cultural and professional environment there is the need for pedagogical personnel capable to carry out continuing training and retraining of mid-level professionals for the real sector of the economy and the social sphere in compliance with the international standards and advanced technologies. Based on the content of scientific sources. a list of systematically important transprofessional competencies to provide psychological readiness of teachers of vocational school for new kinds of activities is drawn up. Results of a diagnostic questioning are described, the respondents were teachers and employees of methodical offices of vocational-oriented education of various colleges of Yekaterinburg and Novouralsk who do not have a basic pedagogical education. Using the processing of the obtained data. it is established that teachers. on the one hand. understand the essence and objectives of their work, on the other. they can not independently respond to their personal needs to reevaluate own professional position due to the use of outdated methods and stereotypic ways of training. Conclusions are drawn that most of the interviewed teachers have no ability to conduct overtime professional activity that enables to carry a standard teaching load, a considerable part of teachers need acquisition of additional pedagogical and transprofessional competencies.The authors outlined the proposal to develop a combinatory technology of psycho-pedagogical support for teachers of vocational schools to improve the current situation. The functionality of this technology. its tasks. structural components. possible methods and estimated effects of its implementation in practice of the SPE (Secondary Professional Education) system are noted.Practical significance. The materials of the present paper can be useful for managerial staff. psychologists and training specialists of the SPE system who are engaged in the issues of teacher professional development.

681,"It has been increasingly discussed and criticized in recent years that due to the growing teacher shortage. more and more career changers are employed. They usually have no school-specific pedagogical qualifications. but they have a high teaching load. However. an in-service training is offered to them, thereby. they are supposed to catch up on teacher training up to the Second State Examination (cp. the contribution by Driesner {\&} Arndt in this issue). The critical discussion of this group's working situation ignores very easily that there is also another big group of untrained ""supply teachers"". who teach at school under even worse circumstances. without any qualification or vocational perspective. This contribution deals with the extent and the conditions of their employment and resulting effects on the quality of teaching. focusing on Hesse. But these ""supply teachers"" also work in other German Lander. for example in Berlin. where they are called ""teachers without full teaching authorization"". As these supply teachers are not recorded in the statistics of the Standing Conference of the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Lander in the Federal Republic of Germany. there are no data regarding their nationwide distribution. Therefore. for the time being. we use a specific case-study to illustrate their complex of problems. PU  - WAXMANN VERLAG GMBH PI  - MUNSTER PA  - STEINFURTER STRASSE 555. MUNSTER. GERMANY"

683,An increase in organizational emergencies warrants investigation into emergency management information systems that serve a novice crisis decision-maker. Small campus-based enterprises such as higher education. and corporate campuses. with no dedicated emergency management offices generally press novice decision-makers into emergency management roles. An investigation was conducted to assess the impact of an emergency management geographic information system (EMGIS) on the decision performance of novice crisis decision-makers through the use of a scenario-based simulation. A mixed method design was used to collect quasi-experimental data on decision time. decision accuracy and situational awareness. Qualitative analysis was also conducted. Statistical results indicated that decision accuracy is positively affected by the use of an EMGIS. Data Envelopment Analysis indicated that efficiency ratios of the EMGIS group outperform the traditional group. Geographic information systems hold much promise in providing systems that are easy to use. promote heightened levels of situational awareness and decision support.   2019 Association for Information Systems.

684,Ministry of Research and Technology of Higher Education in 2017 centralized universities in Indonesia to establish a foundation for classification and ranking of universities in Indonesia in the context of continuous improvement and health of the organization. The clustering is based on criteria 1) Quality of Human Resources. 2) Quality of Management. 3) Quality of Student Activities. and 4) Quality of Research & Publication. The following are the results of the clustering. Cluster 1 is a university whose input. process and output are in a very good category. cluster 2 is in good category. cluster 3 is categorized quite well. cluster 4 is in a poor category. and cluster 5 is very poorly categorized. Input. for example. is lecturer quality. while process is. for example. institutional accreditation and accreditation of the study program and the last output is seen from the many students who received various awards (Kemenristekdikti. 2017). The College Clustering System is very influential on prospective students in making decisions to choose universities to continue their studies. According to [1] higher education is the service industry and service quality is an important determinant of the success of higher education. According to [2] the quality of service is one of the main goals of universities to attract students. Based on that. this study will create a support system for the selection of universities from the 5 clusters based on the dimensions of Service Quality (SerQual). namely 1) Reliability. 2) Responsiveness. 3) Assurance. 4) Empathy. 5) Tangibles. According to [3] decision support systems are popular tools that help make decisions in an organization. One method in the Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) is AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process). According to [4] this AHP is quite effective in simplifying and accelerating the decision-making process by solving the problem in its parts. After a pairwise comparisonby decision makers for each criterion and alternative to obtaining the value of the level of importance of the element in the form of a qualitative opinion. Relative comparison values are then processed according to AHP steps to determine the relative rank of all alternatives. Based on the processing and analysis of data that has been done in the previous section. it can be concluded that universities in cluster 2 are selected based on the criteria of Reliability. Responsiveness. Assurance. Empathy. and Tangibles with a value of 0.261.   2019 IOP Publishing Ltd. All rights reserved.

688,"Quality management systems are a challenge for higher education centers. Nowadays. there are different management systems. for instance: quality. environmental. information security. etc. that can be applied over education centers. but to implement all of them is not a guarantee of education quality because the educational process is very complex. However. a few years ago the Quality Management Systems for higher education centers are taking importance especially in Europe and North America. although in Latin America is an unexplored field. Higher education centers quality is a very complex problem because it is difficult to measure the quality since there are a lot of academic processes as enrollment. matriculation. teaching-learning with a lot of stakeholders as students. teachers. authorities even society, in a lot of locations as campuses. buildings. laboratories with different resources. Each process generates a lot of records and documentation. This information has a varied nature and it is present at a structured and no-structured form. In this context. artificial intelligence techniques can help us to analyze and management knowledge. Our work presents a new approach to audit academic information with machine learning and information retrieval. In our experiments. we used information about syllabus. grades. assessments and online content from a Latin American University. We conclude that using artificial intelligence techniques minimize the decision support time. it allows full data analysis instead of a data sample and it finds out patterns never seen in the case study university.   2020.

689,The integration of innovative data mining and decision-making techniques in the context of higher education is a bold initiative towards enhanced performance. Predictive and descriptive analytics add interesting insights for significant aspects the education. The purpose of this article is to summarize a novel approach for the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques towards forecasting of academic performance. The added value of applying AI techniques for advanced decision making in education is the realization that the scientific approach to standard problems in academia. like the enhancement of academic performance is feasible. For the purpose of this research the authors promote a research in Saudi Arabia. The vision of the Knowledge Society in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a critical milestone towards digital transformation. The human capital and the integration of industry and academia has to be based on holistic approaches to skills and competencies management. One of the main objectives of an academic decision maker is to ensure that academic resources are adequately planned and that students are properly advised. To achieve such an objective. an extensive analysis of large volumes of data may be required. This research develops a decision support system (DSS) that is based on an artificial neural network (ANN) model that can be deployed for effective academic planning and advising. The system is based on evaluating academic metrics against academic performance for students. The model integrates inputs from relevant academic data sources into an autonomous ANN. A simulation of real data on an ANN is conducted to validate the system's accuracy. Moreover. an ANN is compared with different mathematical approaches. The system enables the quality assurance of planning. advising. and the monitoring of academic decisions. The overall contribution of this work is a novel approach to the deployment of Artificial Intelligent for advanced decision making in higher education. In future work this model is integrated with big data and analytics research for advanced visualizations. Copyright   2020. IGI Global.
690,"In this study. educational demographics has been studied in the banking sector within a developing economy context targeting job allocations. In a system view. among organizational demography, educational demographics of staff should be regarded at various educational levels where the number of employees must be determined concerning job leveling and organizational development. This study has been done in a retail bank in Iran and has analyzed the dynamics of educational demographics. Due to interactions between the chain components. the policies and decisions are investigated via system dynamics (SD) method to guarantee the appropriate and balanced growth of the bank. Various policies were simulated. and the consequences of applying them were assessed. Results revealed that a change in the system?s parameters. e.g.. employment rate and training periods are not effective in reaching balanced educational demographics in the long-term. Rather. findings showed that achieving this balance would only be possible through structural changes in the promotion of training and higher education levels as well as personnel regulations development at each level within a 3-year timeframe. Presenting educational demographics in an SD framework as well as applying the simulation model would enable decision aiders to analyze the implications of contrasting decisions in the long run. Furthermore. it demonstrates the dynamics of staff?s educational demographics in financial institutions and banks in a developing economy. Results show that even though the optimal setting for each level of education. which was the number of jobs defined for each level. cannot be achieved in the long run. and in the most efficient case. a 27% deviation from the desired job levels can be achieved. This was due to the multiple time delays existing in the system.   2020. The Society for Reliability Engineering. Quality and Operations Management (SREQOM).

693,Purpose: In this paper. the challenging and thorny issue of assessing graduate attributes (GAs) is addressed. An interdisciplinary team at The University of Alberta ----developed a formative model of assessment centered on students and instructor interaction with course content. Design/methodology/approach: The paper starts by laying the theoretical groundwork on which this novel GA assessment tool is based. that is. competency-based education. assessment theory and GA assessment. It follows with a description of the online assessment tool for GAs that was developed in the course of this project. Findings: The online assessment tool for GAs targets three types of stakeholders: (1) students. who self-assess in terms of GAs. (2) instructors. who use the tool to define the extent to which each GA should be inculcated in their course and (3) administrators. who receive aggregate reports based on the data gathered by the system for high-level analysis and decision-making. Collected data by students and professors advance formative assessment of these transversal skills and assist administration in ensuring the GAs are addressed in academic programs. Graduate attributes assessment program (GAAP) is also a space for students to build a personal portfolio that would be beneficial to highlight their skills for potential employers. Research limitations/implications: This research has strong implications for the universities. since it can help institutions. academics and students achieve better results in their practices. This is done by demonstrating strong links between theory and practice. Although this tool has only been used within the university setting by students. instructors and administrators (for self-. course and teaching and program improvement). it could increase its social and practical impact by involving potential employers and increase our understanding of student employability. Moreover. because the tool collects data on a continuous basis. it lends itself to many possible applications in educational data mining. Practical implications: The GAAP can be used and adapted to various educational contexts. The plugin can be added to any Learning Management System (LMS). and students can have access to their data and results throughout their education. Social implications: The GAAP allows institutions to provide a longitudinal formative assessment of students? graduate attributes acquisition. It provides solid and valid evidence of students? progress in a way that would advance society and citizenship. Originality/value: To date. the GAAP is the first online interactive platform that has been developed to longitudinally assess the acquisition of GAs during a complete academic cycle/cohort. It provides a unique space where students and instructors interact with assessment scales and with concrete data for a complete university experience profile.   2020. Emerald Publishing Limited.
694,Currently. the core trend of Higher Education Institutes (HEI) to invest in decision support systems (DSS) to improve their decision-making process. Due to technology emergence. HEI has been experiencing noteworthy changes. Many techniques such as DSS been adopted developed and implemented to support the educational process. Even though DSS has adopted and invested mainly in most sectors. a lack of research in investigating confirmed. the influencing factors on the intention of stakeholders to continue to use them. Consequently. the purpose of the study is to examine post-adoption users' satisfaction and users? intention to continue using DSS. This study combining two theoretical models. the Technology Acceptance Model. and The Technology Organization Environment Framework. to examine users? intentions to continue using DSS. The data collection process has conducted using 240 respondents. who belong to HEI institutions (Academia and management staff). who work on DSS. Structural Equation Modeling was utilized to analyze structural relationships among the proposed model?s factors. The authors used several methods such as hierarchical regression. one-way ANOVA. descriptive statistics. as well as t-test have applied to evaluate the model's components' relevancy. understanding. and pertinence to each other. The result shows the proposed model fits the data and had a good explanation than the existing models. On the other hand. the results show the importance of equipping DSS with real-time support because they have positive repercussions in the decision-making process The implications as well as the limitations of this study have been extensively discussed.   2021 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

699,"Managing student dropout in higher education is critical. considering its substantial impacts on students' lives. academic institutions. and society as a whole. Using predictive modeling can be instrumental for this task. as a means to identify dropouts proactively on the basis of student characteristics and their academic performance. To enhance these predictions. textual student feedback also might be relevant, this article proposes a hybrid decision support framework that combines predictive modeling with student segmentation efforts. A real-life data set from a French higher education institution. containing information of 14.391 students and 62.545 feedback documents. confirms the superior performance of the proposed framework. in terms of the area under the curve and top decile lift. compared with various benchmarks. In contributing to decision support system research. this study (1) proposes a new framework for automatic. data-driven segmentation of students based on textual data, (2) compares multiple text representation methods and confirms that incorporating student textual feedback data improves the predictive performance of student dropout models, and (3) establishes useful insights to help decision-makers anticipate and manage student dropout behaviors.   2023 Elsevier B.V."
700,Over the last 10 years. learning analytics have provided educators with both dashboards and tools to understand student behaviors within specific technological environments. However. there is a lack of work to support educators in making data-informed design decisions when designing a blended course and planning appropriate learning activities. In this paper. we introduce knowledge-based design analytics that uncover facets of the learning activities that are being created. A knowledge-based visualization is integrated into edCrumble. a (blended) learning design authoring tool. This new approach is explored in the context of a higher education programming course. where instructors design labs and home practice sessions with online smart learning content on a weekly basis. We performed a within-subjects user study to compare the use of the design tool both with and without visualization. We studied the differences in terms of cognitive load. controllability. confidence and ease of choice. design outcomes. and user actions within the system to compare both conditions with the objective of evaluating the impact of using design analytics during the decision-making phase of course design. Our results indicate that the use of a knowledge-based visualization allows the teachers to reduce the cognitive load (especially in terms of mental demand) and that it facilitates the choice of the most appropriate activities without affecting the overall design time. In conclusion. the use of knowledge-based design analytics improves the overall learning design quality and helps teachers avoid committing design errors.   2021.

701,The purpose of this study is to identify the barriers of university and industry cooperation and to develop recommendations for the internal ecosystem of technology commercialization. The research method used is a survey of three categories of expeits from 9 universities of Almaty (researchers. technology transfer managers. spin-off-owners). Despite the strong efforts of the government of Kazakhstan in building innovation infrastructure. there is a low level of innovation activity. less than 5% of university inventions are transferred into the industry. The results of the expert survey showed that the main barriers for cooperation between university and industry are: lack of resources to build university-industry links. lack of time due to high teaching load. poor qualification of technology transfer managers and lack of networking with industry. Based on the results of the expeit survey. it is proposed to develop the ecosystem for the commercialization of university-based technologies. for which the following economic activities are important: human resources. financing. intellectual property management system. and intermediary infrastructure. The results of this study can be applied in developing the strategies and policies for universities. public research organizations. as well as for national R&D and higher education policies.

702,This paper establishes five newfacts about instructional costs in higher education using department-level data from a broad range of institutions. Costs varywidely across fields. ranging fromelectrical engineering (90% higher than English) to math (25% lower). This pattern is largely explained by differences in class size and faculty pay. Some STEM fields experienced steep declines in expenditures over the past 17 years.while others saw increases. Changes in class size and teaching loads alongside a shift toward contingent faculty explain these trends. Finally. the association between online instruction and instructional costs is statistically indistinguishable from zero.   2021 by The University of Chicago.
703,Extensive research has explained women's pandemic-related workforce exodus as driven by the presumed pressures of gender disparate private. domestic burdens. The impact of gender asymmetries in academic labor on faculty well-being is less understood. We examined the effects of job-related factors on faculty mental health. a critical measure of precarity during the initial Spring 2020 ?lockdown? and transition to remote work. Faculty (n = 345) were recruited via social media to participate in a survey on their work/life pandemic experiences. Women were over-represented in our sample. yet respondents at both the highest and the most tenuous ranks were underrepresented. Gender. teaching load. having dependents. and greater financial concerns were associated with higher depression and anxiety. Critically. women's heightened mental health risk was not explained by the other predictors.

The paper asserts that management educators do not perceive the holding of multiple academic roles as a stimulant of any form of mental illness (e.g.. anxiety. depression. stress) if it is accompanied by a sense of autonomy (proper teaching loads. rational time for supervising theses. reasonable requests for research production) a feeling of competence (relevant monthly salary. available training and learning opportunities) and a sense of relatedness (feeling of involvement. flexible work hours. option to work from home).   2022.

705,This paper presents a teaching case of a Blended Learning (BL) approach that was applied to a course on Method Engineering (ME) intended for graduate Business Informatics (BIS) students. The main reason for transforming a Master course on ME from traditional to blended is to take advantage of combining frontal instruction with e-learning based instruction and at the same time reducing lecturers' workload in times of increasing student numbers in BIS and Computer Science (CS) areas. The BL approach consists of three parts. as it consists of the introduction of computer-supported peer assessment. interactive e-lectures. and digital examination. The approach has been reflected upon by course lecturers themselves and it was evaluated through two separate student surveys. from which a variety of positive outcomes can be deduced. Increased generation of feedback. an increase in student motivation. and improved understanding of the course content are three of these outcomes that stand out. On top of student related advantages. especially the BL parts concerning peer assessment and digital examination reduce teaching load. These findings are informative for both education researchers and instructors who are interested in embedding BL in BIS or CS education.   2019 Polish Information Processing Society - as since.
706,It is time to undertake changes in the evaluation methods we use. especially in higher education. These changes in the actors responsible for evaluation would combine hegemonic traditional evaluating processes with other. more democratic modalities. which would turn the predominantly institutional rating purposes of evaluation into a learning experience. and develop a competence in evaluation in students. Only in this way can coherence be achieved within the context of the student's initiative and the construction of their learning. mainly because of their real empowerment in the didactic process. either individually or in groups. A virtual platform has been developed to avoid increasing the teaching load and it is exposed in this work. The platform has been built and validated by potential users following the design-based research model. Its description. as well as its results. are explained. Regarding the description. two interfaces are mentioned-one for teachers and another for students. Concerning its validation. the results of this quantitative and qualitative study confirm its functionality as a valid tool for evaluation. It is predicted that the utilization and impact of this tool will not only be beneficial for the evaluation dimension. but also for the overall improvement of the teaching experience.   2020 by the authors.
707,University course timetabling problem (UCTP) includes the challenging task of generating an automated timetable for courses under resource limitations. Manual generated timetables might hold some errors and consume a long time to create feasible solutions. Thus. there is a need to find optimal and fast solutions for this problem. The difficulty of the timetabling problem is further increased when tackling faculty-related constraints. according to their requirements. preferences. and availability. Thus. student-related constraints are usually the focus of UCTP generated solutions. in which faculty constraints are limited to their teaching load or preferences. This paper proposes a multi-objective mixed-integer programming model for a preregistration UCTP. combined with faculty-related constraints. The goal is to maximize events assignments and faculty-members preferences satisfaction while balancing the university requirements. At the same time. student learning days and unassigned events are minimized. The model is tested with eight real-world instances. Computational experiments are carried out to show the efficiency of the model. The proposed method can generate optimal timetables for all problem instances that satisfy faculty constraints.   2013 IEEE.
708,In programming courses. a good learning platform can reduce the teaching loads and improve the program learning efficiency. Currently. there are many online judge systems on the internet. These systems can automatically check the correctness of the programs submitted by a user. which is very helpful for program learning. However. most of the systems are designed specifically to solve programming problems. not for classroom instruction. After several years of teaching. we decided to design an online platform that is more suitable for our programming courses. The designed platform not only be able to check the correctness of the submitted codes. but also provides some features for teaching. including course management. student management. and problem management. In addition. it can check the format of the submitted code and provide feedback to help students develop a good coding habit. It also provides teachers with software broadcast function. and statistical data to examine the class learning performance. After a semester of testing. we did find that the platform is a very useful teaching tool.   2020 IEEE.
709,"With the continuous improvement of the network hardware environment. people turn the demand target to the network application environment and the construction of information resources. How to build a network teaching platform for general undergraduate teaching to ensure the stability of the system and high-quality services during operation especially large-scale concurrent access will inevitably lead to the increase in the business volume of each core part of the network. the number of visits. and data traffic. With the growth of the network. the corresponding processing power and computing intensity also increase rapidly. which causes problems such as overloading of core network equipment. network bottlenecks. and network congestion. Simply pursuing high-performance hardware to solve problems will undoubtedly result in high cost investment, moreover. equipment with excellent performance cannot meet the needs of the current rapidly growing business volume. According to the design goal of the dance online teaching platform. to meet the online teaching load requirements of many people at the same time. the pressure of the web server cluster must be great. Because many people in online at the same time put too much pressure on the web server. this part of the network cannot be processed in time. which leads to the phenomenon that the performance of this part and even the whole network is degraded. In severe cases. it will even cause network communication services to come to a standstill. that is. the so-called deadlock phenomenon. If the protocol software cannot detect congestion and reduce the packet sending rate. the network will be paralyzed due to congestion. This situation will cause the problem of movement delay for online dance teaching. which will seriously affect the quality of teaching. Therefore. the dance online course system should be continuously improved. the quality of online courses should be continuously improved. and the study of the practical application of load balancing technology in the network teaching environment has become an important means to solve the relationship between supply and demand of network teaching. According to the experimental analysis. when the number of Worker' actuators is fixed. the execution time span of MakeSpan increases with the increase of tasks. while the time required by the optimized load balancing algorithm proposed in this paper increases by 1.32 s on average with the increase of tasks. and the time required by heuristic algorithm and bee colony algorithm increases by 3.68 s and 3.45 s on average with the increase of tasks. On the whole. the optimized load balancing algorithm proposed in this paper has obvious advantages.   2022 Qirong Yang."
710,In recent years. China's economic strength has been developing rapidly. At the same time. people's daily living standards have also been increasingly rising. In this context. the authorities are paying more and more attention to the training of students as well as talents. As a result. the quality of classroom teaching in universities has become a major concern. As an essential evaluation tool for teaching quality. evaluation of classroom teaching has been widely recognised and implemented. With the rapid development of computer technology and information technology. teaching evaluation based on various algorithms has been widely used. thus becoming an increasingly important teaching evaluation method. Thus. classroom teaching assessment has become one of the hot issues discussed in the field of education both at home and abroad. A great number of universities are now fully aware that the effectiveness of teachers is central to their survival and development and can have a direct impact on the training of students. The criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of teaching are highly subjective. but at the same time. there is a considerable degree of objectivity. As a result. the application of more scientific methods and computational data can make the results of classroom assessment more reliable. However. there is a lack of reliable reference data for evaluating the quality of classroom teaching in higher education. In addition. it is difficult to develop an evaluation data management and evaluation management model based on multiple data sources. which may cause a negative effect on the impartiality and objectivity of evaluation results. What is worse. many teachers do not have enough time to interact with their students. After all. most teachers in universities now have a heavy teaching load. and much of their time is spent on lesson preparation. Hence. they usually lack active interaction with their students. In the current education system. the objectives of higher education are mainly test-taking. and practical application is lacking. Therefore. based on the existing teaching basis. how to improve the effectiveness of university classroom teaching and improve the overall quality of students on the basis of test-taking objectives will be a key issue in teaching research. In order to solve this problem. this paper mainly researches the evaluation of classroom teaching quality in universities based on the interval intuitionistic fuzzy theory. This study is based on a detailed analysis of the needs of teaching quality assessment management. in terms of comprehensiveness of assessment and data sources. Then. the teaching evaluation system is designed and developed based on an analysis of the roles of students and teachers. This system can be applied to speed up the efficiency and fairness of teaching evaluation in universities. thereby greatly improving the management of teaching in universities.   2022 Quansong Qi.
711,The article is devoted to the use of manipulative techniques by students for the current and interim attestation in distance learning which is considered as a consequence of ?learned helplessness? (M. Seligman) and ?double bind? (G. Bateson). The problem of psychological manipulation in the ?student?teacher? system is first studied on the basis of the analysis of students? class activities (written works. spoken replies). Students? imitation of academic progress is carried out by using in the MOODLE system such techniques as the presentation of plagiarism. collectively tasks performed. copying of tasks done by other students. answers to didactic tests based on random selection. and many others. ?Double bind? of students is resulting from the contradictory requirements to high quality and at the same time to a sizeable portion of tasks in a limited period of time. In the situation of ?double bind? is also the teacher. who is guided by contradictory attitudes towards the implementation of the criterion (high quality) and statistical approach (comparative analysis without taking into account the criteria of the required quality) in assessing academic work and students? answers. Based on the analysis of the products of students? class activities. the frequency of their use of manipulative techniques for imitating educational competencies when passing credits and exams is characterized. Correlations were found between the frequency of students? use of manipulative techniques and the level of ?learned helplessness? felt by them. as well as the intensity of the ?double bind? among students. The necessity of dosing the teaching load of students when teaching in a distance learning format and special control of authorship of students? academic works presented in the electronic educational milieu is emphasized.   2022.

712,Badminton is a very popular subject in Physical Education (PE). Many students enroll badminton courses in every semester which pose a tremendous teaching load to the instructors. The one-on-one guiding/feedback time provided by the instructor to each student is also greatly reduced. To overcome this challenge. some studies have tried to adopt pose recognition technique in teaching badminton. However. the lack of mobility and recognition accuracy problems hinder its applicability. To address this issue. a new pose recognition technique. OpenPose. was employed to develop a real-time pose recognition badminton teaching APP in this study. The APP was then installed on a mobile device to enhance badminton smash skill learning performance. The scores distribution of the experimental group shows majority of students achieved satisfactory performance. this implies the badminton teaching APP is helpful to all students no matter what their initial skill levels are.   2021 Informa UK Limited. trading as Taylor & Francis Group.
713,Since the focus on the user is becoming increasingly important. the requirements on product modeling tools to design user centered products increase in equal measure. The range of applicable tools is vast. However. the selection of appropriate tools is challenging and depends on a variety of interacting factors that have to be considered. In this paper. an approach to categorize and describe tools of Industrial Design Engineering based on the tasks and models in the design process is presented. aiming at optimizing the specific application in the design process and thus increasing effectivity and efficiency. The potential tools. identified by an extensive research. are initially clustered regarding the essential work on the model (shaping. visualization and transfer). Additionally. for a further categorization. the tools are described by means of parameters according to their characteristics. For a higher-level assignment between tools. models. users and tasks in the design process an evaluation of the tools by use of defined requirements is necessary. Therefore. a study was conducted to investigate the evaluation. exemplarily on 3D modeling tools (Clay Modeling and Polygon Modeling). At first. design processes using those tools were defined in order to derive criteria as basis for the evaluation. Secondly. the visualization and the informative content of the product models with regard to the later product properties were evaluated by conducting a survey with 25 subjects. The results of the study confirm the strong and weak points of the examined modeling tools in relation to the work on the product model in the design process. Considerable differences between the defined tools were observed in terms of complexity of the creation and adaptation process. which can lead to insufficient results by an incorrect application. In addition. the user with his prior knowledge and experience is crucial concerning the perception of the product model and thus the evaluability of the later product characteristics. The developed categorization and evaluation of the modeling tools and the product models provide a good groundwork to reach a targeted application of tools based on the tasks in the design process. the development objectives and environment. as well as the abilities and needs of the user.

715,Hybridisation of metaheuristics is an important subject that has been explored by several researchers. Multiagent systems have been important tools to accomplish the task of hybridising metaheuristics. In those multiagent approaches. however. each metaheuristic is performed separately. and the potential of the hybridisation is not fully explored. In order to bridge this gap. this chapter presents MAHM (multiagent architecture for hybridisation of metaheuristics). a multiagent approach for metaheuristics hybridisation inspired on particle swarm optimisation (PSO). Introduced as a metaheuristic. PSO can be viewed as a multiagent system once particles can be thought as agents that interact and work together to achieve specific goals. In this context. particles are identified to autonomous virtual entities with social ability. reactivity. and pro-activeness. Each agent in MAHM may use different sets of predefined metaheuristics in different moments of the search to look for high-quality solutions of an optimisation problem. Thus. several elements of different metaheuristics can be found running in the swarm every MAHM iteration. In order to show the potentiality of the proposed architecture. computational experiments were carried out with the travelling salesman problem and the quadratic assignment problem. two important test grounds for algorithmic ideas.

716,Staff assignment is a compelling exercise that affects most companies and organizations in the service industries. Here. we introduce a new real-world staff assignment problem that was reported to us by a Swiss provider of commercial employee scheduling software. The problem consists of assigning employees to work shifts subject to a large variety of critical and noncritical requests. including employees? personal preferences. Each request has a target value. and deviations from the target value are associated with integer acceptance levels. These acceptance levels reflect the relative severity of possible deviations. e.g.. for the request of an employee to have at least two weekends off. having one weekend off is preferable to having no weekend off and thus receives a higher acceptance level. The objective is to minimize the total number of deviations in lexicographical order of the acceptance levels. Staff assignment approaches from the literature are not applicable to this problem. We provide a binary linear programming formulation and propose a matheuristic for large-scale instances. The matheuristic employs effective strategies to determine the subproblems and focuses on finding good feasible solutions to the subproblems rather than proving their optimality. Our computational analysis based on real-world data shows that the matheuristic scales well and outperforms commercial employee scheduling software.   2017. Springer Science+Business Media New York.

718,Over the last 13 years. at Sandia National Laboratories we have applied the belief/plausibility measure from evidence theory to estimate the uncertainty for numerous safety and security issues for nuclear weapons. For such issues we have significant epistemic uncertainty and are unable to assign probability distributions. We have developed and applied custom software to implement the belief/plausibility measure of uncertainty. For safety issues we perform a quantitative evaluation. and for security issues (e.g.. terrorist acts) we use linguistic variables (fuzzy sets) combined with approximate reasoning. We perform the following steps: Train Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) on assignment of evidence Work with SMEs to identify the concern(s): the top-level variable(s) Work with SMEs to identify lower-level variable and functional relationship(s) to the top-level variable(s) Then the SMEs gather their State of Knowledge (SOK) and assign evidence to the lower-level variables. Using this information. we evaluate the variables using custom software and produce an estimate for the top-level variable(s) including uncertainty. We have extended the Kaplan-Garrick risk triplet approach for risk to use the belief/plausibility measure of uncertainty.   2019 Westinghouse Electric Company LLC All Rights Reserved
719,"The ability to identify the scholarship of individual authors is essential for performance evaluation. A number of factors hinder this endeavor. Common and similarly spelled surnames make it difficult to isolate the scholarship of individual authors indexed on large databases. Variations in name spelling of individual scholars further complicates matters. Common family names in scientific powerhouses like China make it problematic to distinguish between authors possessing ubiquitous and/or anglicized surnames (as well as the same or similar first names). The assignment of unique author identifiers provides a major step toward resolving these difficulties. We maintain. however. that in and of themselves. author identifiers are not sufficient to fully address the author uncertainty problem. In this study we build on the author identifier approach by considering commonalities in fielded data between authors containing the same surname and first initial of their first name. We illustrate our approach using three case studies. The approach we advance in this study is based on commonalities among fielded data in search results. We cast a broad initial net - i.e.. a Web of Science (WOS) search for a given author's last name. followed by a comma. followed by the first initial of his or her first name (e.g.. a search for 'John Doe' would assume the form: 'Doe. J'). Results for this search typically contain all of the scholarship legitimately belonging to this author in the given database (i.e.. all of his or her true positives). along with a large amount of noise. or scholarship not belonging to this author (i.e.. a large number of false positives). From this corpus we proceed to iteratively weed out false positives and retain true positives. Author identifiers provide a good starting point - e.g.. if 'Doe. J' and 'Doe. John' share the same author identifier. this would be sufficient for us to conclude these are one and the same individual. We find email addresses similarly adequate - e.g.. if two author names which share the same surname and same first initial have an email address in common. we conclude these authors are the same person. Author identifier and email address data is not always available. however. When this occurs. other fields are used to address the author uncertainty problem. Commonalities among author data other than unique identifiers and email addresses is less conclusive for name consolidation purposes. For example. if 'Doe. John' and 'Doe. J' have an affiliation in common. do we conclude that these names belong the same person? They may or may not, affiliations have employed two or more faculty members sharing the same last and first initial. Similarly. it's conceivable that two individuals with the same last name and first initial publish in the same journal. publish with the same co-authors. and/or cite the same references. Should we then ignore commonalities among these fields and conclude they're too imprecise for name consolidation purposes? It is our position that such commonalities are indeed valuable for addressing the author uncertainty problem. but more so when used in combination. Our approach makes use of automation as well as manual inspection. relying initially on author identifiers. then commonalities among fielded data other than author identifiers. and finally manual verification. To achieve name consolidation independent of author identifier matches. we have developed a procedure that is used with bibliometric software called VantagePoint (see www.thevantagepoint.com) While the application of our technique does not exclusively depend on VantagePoint. it is the software we find most efficient in this study. The script we developed to implement this procedure is designed to implement our name disambiguation procedure in a way that significantly reduces manual effort on the user's part. Those who seek to replicate our procedure independent of VantagePoint can do so by manually following the method"
720,Objective-To synthesize student narratives on searching for an item in the library and to identify information literacy threshold concepts students encountered during their searching. Design-Constant comparative analysis. Setting-Academic library at an urban American university. Subjects-A sample of 97 1-to-2 page ungraded first year student essays. Methods-A library assignment was developed for first year students in a required academic skills course. Students wrote the essay for peer mentors. After completing the essay. students were asked if they wanted to participate in the study. For the assignment. students were asked to find a library item of interest and write a reflective essay on the process. Essays were analyzed using NVIVO software. The researchers developed codes independently. then came together to review. discuss and recode the essays. Using the constant comparison method. themes were identified from the coding. Narrative analysis was used to understand the coding in the context of the students' experiences. Main Results-The authors outlined various search paths that the students described in their essays. The main emotional responses in the essays were surprise. confusion. and excitement. Three ACRL Framework IL concepts were identified in the analysis: Scholarship as Conversation. Searching as Strategic Exploration. and Research as Inquiry. Scholarship as a Conversation was exemplified through students' selection of a library item. Students chose topics that were of academic interest or associated with personal identity. In the essays. students explained their connection to the item they found. making the connection to the ongoing scholarly conversation. Searching as Strategic Exploration was expressed through student descriptions of connecting the call number to the subject classifications. Some students sailed through. whereas others encountered challenges. Some found that previous library mental models failed. found the catalogue overwhelming. or thought the organization of material was at fault rather than their own skills. Some students described how they overcame their challenges. Students also discussed balancing self-reliance and seeking help when searching for an item. This related to the ACRL frames of Research as Inquiry and Searching as Strategic Exploration. Attitudes on seeking help ranged from complete reliance to anxiety. Conclusion-This library assignment offered students the opportunity to pursue their own interests and goals. It also encouraged exploration. problem-solving. and reflection. The assignment design allowed students to grapple with information literacy threshold concepts in a safe and independent environment. demonstrating learning and engagement with academia.   2019 MacDonald.
721,Computer vision (CV) techniques were applied to X-ray computed tomographic (CT) images of reservoir cores to evaluate their potential for rapidly identifying fractures and other lithologic/geologic characteristics. The analyses utilized feature-labeled CT cross sectional images. themselves distributed submillimeter voxels of density- and atomic number-sensitive CT Numbers. as inputs to a Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCN) for semantic segmentation of reservoir core features. In FCN. an image is interrogated using a series of sliding windows at various scales to create weighted filters to reduce error between classes in training images. These networks of filter layers were used to assign probabilities of classes. which were upscaled back to the original image dimensions resulting in probabilistic class assignments onto each pixel. FCN model accuracy. defined by its ability to replicate manually-assigned labels in the raw (unannotated) training image stack. was at least 80% and generally improved with the size of the training set. Once the labels were assigned. the underlying feature frequency. orientation. and size were measured in 3D volume reconstructions using algorithms modified from standard image analysis software. This method allowed users to endow a classification model with subject matter knowledge for further. autonomous label prediction. Thus. while initial image annotation was labor intensive. subsequent images were rapidly classified once the model was built. The classified labels were analyzed for abundance. orientation. and size of fractures were calculated to characterize spatial information of these features. FCN combined with fracture labeling improved knowledge capture and automation of fracture identification. Models trained by high quality 3D datasets can greatly reduce the time needed to describe subsequent core. The method demonstrated is not limited to fractures. other lithologic/geologic features could be trained using the same method. which may result in additional efficiencies. Copyright 2019.

722,Study objective: To estimate the prevalence of unscheduled absences in a cohort of certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs) over a 3-year period. for purposes of critiquing statistical review of individual providers relative to potential identification of patterns of such absences. Design: Retrospective. observational study. Setting: University hospital. Subjects: 99 CRNAs performing clinical assignments in the operating rooms. Interventions: None. Measurements: CRNA daily clinical assignments and unscheduled absences were retrieved from the department's staff assignment software package. Data were extracted and analyzed to estimate the prevalence of unscheduled absences by CRNAs by day of the week. and whether each absence occurred on the workday before or after either a holiday or a personal vacation. A statistical power analysis was performed to determine the number of workdays of data required to identify outlier personnel above the 95th percentile among all CRNAs while controlling for a family-wise error rate of 5%. Main results: The overall incidence of unscheduled absences pooled by days was 1.7%. with small differences among days of the week. and before or after vacations. A year of data would be required to detect outliers for unscheduled absences exceeding the 95% upper confidence limit among all CRNAs. Attempting to identify patterns of absences being on specific days of the week or as related to holidays and vacations would require multiple years of data. Conclusions: OR managers can detect CRNAs with excessive numbers of unscheduled absences. but at least a year of data is required. Detecting apparent ?patterns? of absences would require multiple years of data and is thus impractical.   2018 Elsevier Inc.
723,A project-based course involving the design. analysis. manufacturing. testing. and launching of mid-power solid-propellant rockets over a ten-week period has been developed and taught as an approach to enhance the education and preparation of aerospace engineers at the university level. The course consists of a sequence of structured laboratory assignments that expose students to common software tools. aerospace materials. manufacturing techniques. and testing methods that directly inform and run parallel to the project. Teams of four to five students complete the project (and portions of the labs) collaboratively within an engineering competition framework. Individual students within each team are assigned specific engineering roles (e.g. design engineer. manufacturing engineer) to create an interdependence that reflects a typical integrated product team in industry and exposes students to realistic social dynamics. Student teams conduct design reviews as progressive milestones for assessment. in addition to laboratory assignments. At a per-student cost on the same order as a textbook. the project-based course combines theoretical content from several subjects with a high-order learning approach (create. evaluate. analyze) to advance the engineering skills of university students.   2018 IAA
724,"In this study. it is aimed to develop a user-friendly open-source web-based software which enables the assignment of the subjects included in the scientific research to the groups with equal probability. An open source R package. Shiny. is used to develop the recommended web tool. In the developed software. one of the required equilibrium methods, random allocation rule. truncated binomial design. maximal procedure design. complete randomization methods, complete randomization design. blocking methods, permuted block randomization with random block constellation. the Hadamard randomization. adaptive methods, the big stick design. Efron's biased coin design. Wei's urn design. generalized biased coin design. Chen's biased coin design are included. A random allocation rule. one of the random assignment methods. is applied to a hypothetical data set where the sample size is 140 and the number of groups are two. As a result. in the first group. a random assignment was made in such a way that the number of samples are 70 and the number of samples in the second group are 70. According to the hypothetical data set findings. the developed easily assigns the subjects to the study groups by using random assignment methods. Therefore. it is stated that it easily solved a significant bias problem in scientific studies.

725,"In this paper. we propose a new heuristic as well as several improvements to an existing approach based on Benders decomposition for solving the conflict free scheduling and routing of automated guided vehicles (AGVs). with promising results. The existing method solves the problem in two stages, task assignment/sequencing. and feasibility check of the first stage's solution subject to collision-avoidance constraints. The method is not suitable for large-scale AGV systems. We proposed several improvements and speedup strategies that result in fast methods capable of scheduling AGVs in a realistic layout with a graph of several hundred nodes and arcs. This is done by reformulating the mathematical model of the problem. We also introduce a new heuristic based on the improved method that yields high-quality solutions quickly. Moreover. we solve a real large-scale industrial instance by a commercial constraint programming solver and an open-source SMT solver. The results show that both of these general-purpose solvers can effectively solve our proposed models.   2019 IEEE."
726,The decoupling of data plane and control plane. which is the key feature of Software-Defined Networking (SDN). introduces considerable communication overhead between controllers and switches. Multiple distributed controllers are introduced in the control plane to improve the scalability and reliability of SDN. Controller placement problem and controller-switch mapping assignment problem are two of most critical challenges in multi-controller SDN. In this paper. we study the dynamic controller-switch mapping assignment problem for SDN. so as to minimize the average event response time from switches. We build the model in a generic way that can be used in both static and dynamic policies. The controller-switch mapping assignment procedure is formulated as a nonlinear integer programming problem. Due to the high cost of brute force and the locality of other heuristic algorithms in solving the formulated problem. we develop a genetic algorithm to solve the problem. Under the assumption that each controller subjects an M/M/1 queuing system. we simulate the proposed genetic algorithm in a static example of the model. Simulation results reveal that the proposed algorithm minimizes the average response time of events while incurring low computational overhead.   2019 IEEE.
727,A profound analysis of pressure and flow wave propagation in cardiovascular systems is the key in noninvasive assessment of hemodynamic parameters. Pulse transit time (PTT). which closely relates to the physical properties of the cardiovascular system. can be linked to variations of blood pressure and stroke volume to provide information for patient-specific clinical diagnostics. In this work. we present mathematical and numerical tools. capable of accurately predicting the PTT. local pulse wave velocity. vessel compliance. and pressure/flow waveforms. in a viscous hyperelastic cardiovascular network. A new one-dimensional framework. entitled cardiovascular flow analysis (CardioFAN). is presented to describe the pulsatile fluid?structure interaction in the hyperelastic arteries. where pertaining hyperbolic equations are solved using a high-resolution total variation diminishing Lax?Wendroff method. The computational algorithm is validated against well-known numerical. in vitro and in vivo data for networks of main human arteries with 55. 37 and 26 segments. respectively. PTT prediction is improved by accounting for hyperelastic nonlinear waves between two arbitrary sections of the arterial tree. Consequently. arterial compliance assignments at each segment are improved in a personalized model of the human aorta and supra-aortic branches with 26 segments. where prior in vivo data were available for comparison. This resulted in a 1.5% improvement in overall predictions of the waveforms. or average relative errors of 5.5% in predicting flow. luminal area and pressure waveforms compared to prior in vivo measurements. The open source software. CardioFAN. can be calibrated for arbitrary patient-specific vascular networks to conduct noninvasive diagnostics.   2019.

728,"Students often approach biochemistry with a degree of trepidation with many considering it one of the more difficult subjects. This is. in part. due to the necessity of making visual images of submicroscopic concepts. Molecular interactions underpin most biological processes, therefore. mastering these concepts is essential. Understanding the forces and mechanisms that underpin protein-ligand interactions is a key learning goal for mastering the protein structure-function relationship. We intended to overcome such learning barriers by implementing assignment-based activities across three successive biochemistry cohorts. The activities involved 3D printed proteins and cheminformatics/molecular modeling software activities which had the advantage of targeting students' visual-spatial ability. Learning activities. conducted in small groups. were specifically designed to enhance understanding of the protein structure-function relationship through a detailed analysis of molecular-level interactions between proteins and ligands. Here we describe the methodology for preparation of the learning tools and how they were incorporated in the learning exercises in the form of both formative and summative assessments. We compared their perceived effectiveness via student feedback surveys conducted over three consecutive cohorts. Survey results showed students were positively engaged with these technologies with a slight preference for cheminformatics. From an instructor's perspective. we found significantly improved overall grade averages for the subjects following implementation of the assignments which may suggest these tools contributed to enhanced understanding. While print resolution could not match that of cheminformatics software. we present evidence to support their continued incorporation in the course. Feedback obtained will inform future curriculum development. Copyright   2019 American Chemical Society and Division of Chemical Education. Inc."
729,Undergraduate computer-aided design (CAD) courses can have large enrollments. making it difficult for instructors to thoroughly assess each student's assignments and provide individualized feedback. While in some subject areas textbook companies are developing online platforms that adapt problem sets to meet each individual student's needs. there has been apparently little attention to the area of individualized CAD instruction. This paper presents a program that compares students? two-dimensional CAD drawings to a solution. computes the number of missing or erroneous features in each student's drawing. and generates a visual comparison of each student's drawing with the solution. The system is implemented both as an offline version for batch processing and an online version for immediate student feedback on assignments. While the system lacks the ?smartness? of a human grader. the offline version substantially reduces time spent grading exams and improves grading accuracy and consistency. and the online version encourages students to focus on important details of drawing and provides immediate online feedback for students as they complete assignments. as well as providing after-the-fact feedback on exams.   2019 Wiley Periodicals.

730,Objective. The precise localization of intracranial electrodes is a fundamental step relevant to the analysis of intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings in various fields. With the increasing development of iEEG studies in human neuroscience. higher requirements have been posed on the localization process. resulting in urgent demand for more integrated. easy-operation and versatile tools for electrode localization and visualization. With the aim of addressing this need. we develop an easy-to-use and multifunction toolbox called iEEGview. which can be used for the localization and visualization of human intracranial electrodes. Approach. iEEGview is written in Matlab scripts and implemented with a GUI. From the GUI. by taking only pre-implant MRI and post-implant CT images as input. users can directly run the full localization pipeline including brain segmentation. image co-registration. electrode reconstruction. anatomical information identification. activation map generation and electrode projection from native brain space into common brain space for group analysis. Additionally. iEEGview implements methods for brain shift correction. visual location inspection on MRI slices and computation of certainty index in anatomical label assignment. Main results. All the introduced functions of iEEGview work reliably and successfully. and are tested by images from 28 human subjects implanted with depth and/or subdural electrodes. Significance. iEEGview is the first public Matlab GUI-based software for intracranial electrode localization and visualization that holds integrated capabilities together within one pipeline. iEEGview promotes convenience and efficiency for the localization process. provides rich localization information for further analysis and offers solutions for addressing raised technical challenges. Therefore. it can serve as a useful tool in facilitating iEEG studies.   2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.
731,The research aims at designing and verifying an automated system for online learning in Programming languages. Such systems were designed to provide students' independent theoretical training and exercising within in-person learning and are able to operate on their own. Nginx. Docker. Gunicorn. Django. Python. PostgreSQL. HTML5. and CSS Framework were applied. Testing was held at Sholom-Aleichem Priamursky State University and Pacific National University in the 2019-2020 academic year.

The designed system Steach.space has a user-friendly interface. contains modules for developing integrated/built-in courses. providing teaching AIDS and tests. computer-assisted verification of assignments in Programming. and observing statistics/history on student learning. The software can be used for teaching programming languages. as well as other subject domains.   Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.
732,The paper deals with the issue of detecting plagiarism in source code. which we unfortunately encounter when teaching subjects dealing with programming and software development. Many students want to simplify the completion of the course and therefore submit modified source codes of their classmates or even those found on the Internet. Some try to modify the source code e.g. by changing the identifiers of classes. methods and variables to different ones. by changing the corresponding loops. by introducing new methods or by changing the order of methods in the source code or in other ways. We focused directly on this problem and designed our own anti-plagiarism system that we describe in this paper. The designed system consists of three parts during which the source code is processed using six designed algorithms. The basis is the processing of the source code and its transformation into an abstract syntax tree. consisting of two types of nodes. which is then vectorized using our modified DECKARD algorithm. The vectors are then clustered and stored in a database from which similar parts of the source code can be searched. The output of the system is then the final report containing a list of matches with similarities of all works that have been added to the database until then. The designed anti-plagiarism system is finally compared with the success of plagiarism detection performed by the two most used anti-plagiarism tools. namely JPlag and MOSS. It is evaluated on assignments elaborated by students from the courses dealing with object-oriented programming at our faculty.   2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

733,A distributed control plane is more scalable and robust in software defined networking. This paper focuses on controller load balancing using packet-in request redirection. that is. given the instantaneous state of the system. determining whether to redirect packet-in requests for each switch. such that the overall control plane response time (CPRT) is minimized. To address the above problem. we propose a framework based on Lyapunov optimization. First. we use the drift-plus-penalty algorithm to combine CPRT minimization problem with controller capacity constraints. and further derive a non-linear program. whose optimal solution is obtained with brute force using standard linearization techniques. Second. we present a greedy strategy to efficiently obtain a solution with a bounded approximation ratio. Third. we reformulate the program as a problem of maximizing a non-monotone submodular function subject to matroid constraints. We implement a controller proto-type for packet-in request redirection. and conduct trace-driven simulations to validate our theoretical results. The results show that our algorithms can reduce the average CPRT by 81.6% compared to static controller-switch assignment. and achieve a 3? improvement in maximum controller capacity violation ratio.   2020 IEEE.
734,Background and aims: Job ability in the midwifery profession is highly important due to the critical role played by midwives as one of the effectual components of the health system for providing midwifery services to two vulnerable groups in society. i.e.. mothers and children. Job ability denotes the balance between a person?s ability to work and the occupational demands of the job in question. Job ability is defined in this model as the degree to which a person is physically or mentally able to adapt to the job requirements based on his/her health condition. The most significant factor considered in this model is individual health. In fact. in this model. health is one of the crucial components of job ability. not one of its determinants. In this case. job ability can be affected by various factors such as physical and psycho-social factors. occupational factors. physical and mental abilities. and lifestyle. The imbalance between these factors and one?s health can lead to reduced production. sick leave. and eventually work-related disabilities. Midwifery is one of the jobs where midwives are exposed to high stress daily. which can affect their job ability. In Iran. according to research findings. midwives? job ability is on an average level. Therefore. it is necessary to take effective measures to improve midwives? mental health and thus increase their job ability. One way that may prevent these disorders is to consider midwives? well-being. The PERMA model is one of the positive psychological interventions recently developed by Seligman (2011) to help increase the well-being of individuals. The model consists of the five components of positive emotion (P). engagement (E). positive relationships (R). meaning (M) and accomplishment (A). where each component can independently enhance well-being. and the power of each component can help individuals find a happy. satisfying. meaningful life. Therefore. among interventions that are likely to affect midwives? job ability are those based on positive psychology ? an approach in psychotherapy associated with the creation of positive abilities and emotions. It aims to alleviate and tranquilize psychological trauma and to enhance happiness and well-being by increasing meaning to individuals? lives. In recent years. the positivist approach in organizations has been considered as an optimal approach to influence different job outcomes. and some scholars have tried to translate its concepts into practical actions and interventions through which they can produce positive results. Accordingly. this study aimed to investigate the effect of positive psychotherapy-based group education on midwives? job ability in Mashhad. Methods: The present study was a randomized clinical trial with pretest-posttest design with control group that lasted from September 23. 2015 to March 20. 2016. The statistical population of the study included all midwives working in community health centers of Mashhad City. Iran. For sampling purposes. centers 1 and 3 were selected via cluster sampling method from among the five community health centers located in Mashhad city. Subsequently. all centers and subsidiaries affiliated with these centers were enlisted. Each of them was assigned a number from 0 to 113. and a small card with the corresponding number was issued. All the cards were put in a box. Each time. after shaking the box. one card was randomly taken out. and the number was recorded successively as either the intervention group or the control group. This process was reiterated until all the centers were allocated to the intervention or control groups. In this way. information dissemination between the two groups was prevented. Then. the researcher visited the intervention and control centers and invited all eligible midwives (who take care of mothers) to participate in the study. The sample size was obtained using the formula for comparing the means. and based on the results of the pilot study with 95% confide
735,Bug assignment is the task of ranking candidate developers in terms of their potential competence to fix a bug report. Numerous methods have been developed to address this task. relying on different methodological assumptions and demonstrating their effectiveness with a variety of empirical studies with numerous data sets and evaluation criteria. Despite the importance of the subject and the attention it has received from researchers. there is still no unanimity on how to validate and comparatively evaluate bug-assignment methods and. often times. methods reported in the literature are not reproducible. In this paper. we first report on our systematic review of the broad bug-assignment research field. Next. we focus on a few key empirical studies and review their choices with respect to three important experimental-design parameters. namely. the evaluation metric(s) they report. their definition of who the real assignee is. and the community of developers they consider as candidate assignees. The substantial variability on these criteria led us to formulate a systematic experiment to explore the impact of these choices. We conducted our experiment on a comprehensive data set of bugs we collected from 13 long-term open-source projects. using a simple Tf-IDf similarity metric. On the basis of our arguments and/or experiments. we provide useful guidelines for performing further bug-assignment research. We conclude that mean average precision (MAP) is the most informative evaluation metric. the developer community should be defined as ?all the project members.? and the real assignee should be defined as ?any developer who worked toward fixing a bug.?.   2020 John Wiley & Sons.

736,"Research review of urban traffic planning (including routes planning. distribution of vehicles between routes. timetabling and drivers assignment) using periodic and aperiodic timetables is given. Peculiarities of timetabling process in Russia and former USSR countries are described using the Public Transport Network and Event Transport Network presentation. The main goal of the research is creating of math model for solving the main task of schedules theory for high speed urban tramways with peculiarities of timetables mentioned of former Soviet countries. Tasks of this research are analyzing of previous works in this field. formalizing of subject area and creating of a math model which can be practically used. program implementation of the suggested model and analyzing its complexity. The concept of hybrid timetables is proposed. These timetables are similar to cyclic timetables inside the middle of one period of a day and they are similar to non-cyclic timetables inside period borders. Their usage helps to avoid most of limitations of non-cyclic schedules and it is convenient to use them for high-speed urban transport are defined in the article as a new class of schedules. Math model of hybrid timetables was suggested by the author. Polynomial complexity of the model was shown because it is analog of non-cyclic schedules. Software implementation of hybrid timetables model is described. Practical application recommendations of hybrid timetables usage are given on example of Automated System ""Raspisanie Transporta""(AS RT). using example of the new high-speed tramway in St. Petersburg. Main tasks solved by this information system are described. Module structure of AS RT includes car distribution and trace planning modules. input-output module. core calculation module and graphical user interface module.

737,The expectation to absorb information is the most critical advance in the beginning periods of utilizing a programming dialect. The most prominent are C/C ++ and Java. In a scholastic domain. homework is essential to guarantee suitable learning. E-learning is increasing across the board utilize and is utilized as an essential strategy for training. particularly in advanced education. Manual assessment of the program by the teacher or a specialist is an ease back process subject to mistakes and manual blunders. The assessment and programmed assessment of understudy reactions/exercises assume an essential part in enhancing e-learning and give educators a long haul and long-haul errand of physically surveying and grouping understudy assignments/programs. Online work conveyance frameworks help instructors with time administration issues and understudy evaluation forms. It gives understudies a feeling of viable utilization of the hypothetical ideas educated in the classroom. A decent style of writing computer programs is imperative for programming experts. In composition. manual control of programming undertakings is a dull assignment. Current programming assignments are not confirmed for all experiments. The reason for this archive is to investigate the accessible instruments. plan and build up an online intelligent application that PC understudies can use to send programming errands and get criticism continuously. We have proposed a model for the programmed assessment and capability of the Java programs exhibited by the understudies amid the introduction of the paper term or a handy exam. The online application that has been planned and created in view of this archive comprises of an approval. introduction and investigation part.   2018 IEEE.
738,Nowadays general learning programs in Bachelor?s degrees in engineering have gradually adapted towards the inclusion of more electronics oriented subjects. The prominent growth of technology applications reveals its influence on the design of such education plans at university. Most of them introduce advanced methodologies. which in most cases. are principally sustained by ICT (Information. Communication and Technology) tools. In this work. we assess the effectiveness of a learning program for an electronics course. based on the developed methodology of a previous work. which has been periodically renewed each year. during the six last academic years. In particular. we analyse the achievement of students when using additional digital resources such as circuit simulation. by means of an online Java applet. Moreover. the scope of the analysis has been statistically extended in order to compare with the benefits associated to the use of other digital resources and to extract possible inferences. In this sense. an e-learning platform (Moodle) with auxiliary materials is made available to the students. Besides Java simulation examples and an assignment. video lessons. practical lessons explanations. interactive exercises. and a Problem-Based Learning (PBL) group assignment. are hosted in Moodle. Group testing has been considered for the arrangement of students during the academic year 2018?2019. in order to obtain unbiased achievement results. According to such results. the use of a Java simulation applet (JSA) demonstrates relevant achievement in contrast to the other resources. In addition. the results also comprise the satisfaction and attitude to the whole program. reported by students. Finally. further inferences are extracted from history data of the course. since academic year 2013?2014 to the current academic year. 2018?2019.   Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.
739,It has long been a goal of educators to accurately identify at-risk students early enough in the term to intervene. and the increasing availability of programming process data and learning analytics tools has brought education researchers closer to realizing that objective. The Normalized Programming State Model (NPSM). for example. a recent approach that considers students' editing and testing behaviors in addition to compilations. has been shown to predict a student's overall course grade with 36-67% accuracy [14] depending on the number of assignments analyzed. To date. NPSM has not been evaluated outside of its original context: a group of CS2 students writing C++ programs in Visual Studio. We re-implemented NPSM to analyze the program-development processes of Java programmers using the BlueJ IDE. and applied the model to data collected from 9.338 subjects working to solve a specific programming exercise from the BlueJ textbook. While our study does not yet establish the predictive abilities of NPSM in this new domain. our contributions include the reimplementation of an existing model - something the education research community has established as a priority - and a preliminary exploration of the kinds of programming activity an NPSM implementation will encounter when working with BlueJ users. We identify differences between IDEs that necessarily lead to variations in their NPSM models. and highlight aspects of NPSM and this new context that suggest NPSM's predictive power is likely to decrease for BlueJ programmers.   2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).
740,Software Defined Radio (SDR) technologies play today an important role in modern wireless networks due to their flexibility to implement re-configurable hardware designs. In light of the importance to operate and develop such technologies. academic programs in the communications engineering field demand an introduction to Digital Signal Processing (DSP) and SDR communication schemes accordingly. Typically. the teaching of this subject is afforded through projects and hands-on activities in classrooms. However. provided their relevance in the current state-of-the-art. this topic also provides a framework to teach soft skills concerning research abilities in students. This paper introduces an academic program to the development of SDR functionality as well as research skills based on exposure to state-of-the-art research. Through projects. hands-on activities are conducted to teach digital signal processing designs using Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology. The course aims to develop technical skills to implement communication system blocks. Besides. workshops and seminars are prepared to support the development of research and communication skills. The proposed course is flexible to incorporate on a given academic program as an elective subject to further support topics related to communication theory and discrete-time signals. Learning outcomes are designed to develop enhanced technical skills in SDR design and simultaneously a critical discussion of the devised solutions in light of the state-of-the-art. Also. skills related to identifying. formulating. and discussing engineering problems are further reinforced. Results from supported projects developed in the classroom exhibit completed assignments superior to 90% of participant students. Learning objectives concerning the technical skills were successfully covered (90%) in comparison to research and communicating skills (80%). Additionally. research skills and the ability to disseminate knowledge gradually improved in seminars. Finally. results of the current course exhibit improvements of 25% regarding the acquired skills in digital signal processing in comparison to previous courses.   2013 IEEE.
741,Assigning class responsibility is a design decision to be made early in the design phase in software development. which bridges requirements and an analysis model. In general. assigning class responsibility relies heavily on the expertise and experience of the developer. and it is often ad-hoc. Class responsibility assignment rules are hard to be uniformly defined across the various domains of systems. Thus. the existing work describes general stepwise guidelines without concrete methods. which imposes the limit in deriving an analysis model from requirements specification without any loss of information and providing sufficient quality of the analysis model. This study tried to grasp the commonality and variations in analyzing the business application domain. By narrowing the subject of the solution. the presented patterns can help identify and assign class responsibilities for a system belonging to the business application domain. The presented pattern language consists of six segmented patterns. including 19 variations of relationship type among conceptual classes. Each sequence of a use case specification could be analyzed as the result of weaving a set of the six segmented patterns. A case study with a payroll system is presented to prove the patterns? feasibility. explaining how the proposed patterns can develop an analysis model. The coverage of the proposing CRA patterns and enhancement of implementation code quality is discussed as the benefit.   2021
742,Pair learning (PL) in robotics education is derived from pair programming. and impacted by many factors. Two important factors were identified including roles assignment and learning styles in this study. The roles assignment involved Driver?Navigator Pair and Software?Hardware Pair. For the learning style. the dimension of active/reflective was adopted. Therefore. a 2*3 factorial design was employed with the between-subjects factors roles assignment and learning styles. After a one-semester robotics course. we evaluated 66 fifth-grade students? learning achievements. attitude towards robotics. engagement. mental efforts. compatibility. and attitude towards PL. The results indicated that there was no statistically significant difference among different pairs in the above six indicators. Moreover. there was no significant difference in the learning outcomes among pairs of different learning styles. One important explanation is that the joint effect of PL might bridge the difference in learning performance that may be caused by learning style.   2019. Springer Nature B.V.

745,According to the popularity of Android smartphone devices. the demand for Android application programmers has been increasing rapidly. Due to this fact. the subject of mobile application programming based on Android smartphones has become one of the important subjects in software development fields. In Android applications. the user interface takes an important role to make it interactive. Based on previous studies. the Android Programming Learning Assistance System (APLAS) has been used as a self-learning platform for Android programming studies. In this paper. we propose a web-based platform in APLAS for learning user interface design interactively using XML code. The 15 learning topics as learning materials cover the learning of UI layout and application resources. Students will get an assignment to be solved in each topic and the answer can be validated automatically on the server. To evaluate the effectiveness of this platform. we asked 40 students in an IT department in Indonesia to solve all topics. As the result. all students have successfully solved the 15 provided topics on schedule. Also. they gave positive comments regarding the ease of the learning process. which has confirmed the feasibility of our proposal to support learning UI design using XML.   2021 IEEE.
746,Background: Wearable activity trackers are regarded as a new opportunity to deliver health promotion interventions. Indeed. while the prediction of active behaviors is currently primarily relying on the processing of accelerometer sensor data. the emergence of smart clothes with multi-sensing capacities is offering new possibilities. Algorithms able to process data from a variety of smart devices and classify daily life activities could therefore be of particular importance to achieve a more accurate evaluation of physical behaviors. This study aims to (1) develop an activity recognition algorithm based on the processing of plantar pressure information provided by a smart-shoe prototype and (2) to determine the optimal hardware and software configurations. Method: Seventeen subjects wore a pair of smart-shoe prototypes composed of plantar pressure measurement insoles. and they performed the following nine activities: sitting. standing. walking on a flat surface. walking upstairs. walking downstairs. walking up a slope. running. cycling. and completing office work. The insole featured seven pressure sensors. For each activity. at least four minutes of plantar pressure data were collected. The plantar pressure data were cut in overlapping windows of different lengths and 167 features were extracted for each window. Data were split into training and test samples using a subject-wise assignment method. A random forest model was trained to recognize activity. The resulting activity recognition algorithms were evaluated on the test sample. A multi hold-out procedure allowed repeating the operation with 5 different assignments. The analytic conditions were modulated to test (1) different window lengths (1?60 seconds). (2) some selected sensor configurations and (3) different numbers of data features. Results: A window length of 20 s was found to be optimum and therefore used for the rest of the analysis. Using all the sensors and all 167 features. the smart shoes predicted the activities with an average success of 89%. ?Running? demonstrated the highest sensitivity (100%). ?Walking up a slope? was linked with the lowest performance (63%). with the majority of the false negatives being ?walking on a flat surface? and ?walking upstairs.? Some 2- and 3-sensor configurations were linked with an average success rate of 87%. Reducing the number of features down to 20 does not alter significantly the performance of the algorithm. Conclusion: High-performance human behavior recognition using plantar pressure data only is possible. In the future. smart-shoe devices could contribute to the evaluation of daily physical activities. Minimalist configurations integrating only a small number of sensors and computing a reduced number of selected features could maintain a satisfying performance. Future experiments must include a more heterogeneous population. Copyright 2020 Ren et al.
747,Introduction Obesity is a constantly rising and cost-intensive medical issue worldwide. Severe obesity often needs surgery to promote weight loss. but due to the rapid therapeutic success after the surgery. many patients lack the awareness of the need to consistently maintain the postoperative care. However. therapeutic success and psychological well-being can be increased through group interventions and social support of the group members. Therefore. aftercare via group intervention is a promising approach. In this prospective randomised controlled study. the self-efficacy in a social media-based interactive. psychoeducational intervention is to be tested. Methods and analysis The intervention group will complete a social media-supported group intervention for 6 weeks with weekly postings of educative contents and the possibility to exchange in groups via anonymous avatars. The control group will receive treatment as usual (TAU) after the obesity surgery as recommended in the German S3-guidelines Obesity Surgery and Metabolic Surgery. We will examine the effectiveness of a social media-supported intervention group. and therefore. the change in self-efficacy expectation. For the primary outcome. we will perform a mixed analysis of variance with time as the within-subject factor (times of measurement T0-T4) and the group assignment as the between-subject factor (intervention +TAU vs TAU group). Ethics and dissemination The study was approved by the Medical Association North Rhine (Arztekammer Nordrhein. 2020031) and the patient enrolment will begin in July 2021. Trial registration number DRKS00018089.  
748,During the COVID-19 pandemic. lecturers carry out online learning and this condition also force student to learn independently.

749,Software Engineering and Computer Science (CS) programs often contain several mathematical courses or courses with large mathematics components or dependencies. Study success in those subjects can be influenced by students' attitudes towards mathematics and their perceptions about their own relation with mathematics. To gain insights into how the mathematics perceptions of computer science students affect their studies. we collected qualitative data from fourteen CS students from two universities in the context of an elective mathematics course. In this qualitative research. we used a triangulation strategy by collecting data from three different sources (interviews. questionnaires. and math-history assignments) to develop a comprehensive understanding of CS students' mathematics perceptions. The thematic analysis revealed the factors that affect students' perceptions about mathematics. including various types of prior experiences. their self-efficacy. math anxiety. and motivation sources. The analysis also highlighted that students find mathematics important for skill transfer to specific CS topics and for supporting continuous learning.   2022 IEEE.
750,Marine current conversion systems with permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) have several advantages over the renewable energies and is gradually replacing it in the industry. Non-linear equations describe the dynamics of the PMSG. It is subject to unknown external disturbances (load). and its parameters are variable in time. All these constraints make the control task complex. It requires non-linear controls that compensate for non-linearities. external disturbances. and parametric variations. This paper investigates an interconnection and damping assignment passivity-based control (IDA-PBC) h for the PMSG using the model represented in the dq-frame. Inherent advantages of the IDA-PBC method are that the non-linear properties are not canceled but compensated in a damped way. The proposed PBC is responsible for designing the system's desired dynamic. The efficiency of the suggested technique is investigated numerically using MATLAB/Simulink software.   2022.

751,Software-based training supports maintenance or recovery of cognitive abilities. However. regular use needs a high self-motivation. For this. the individual needs of users should be taken into account during the development process. Thus. in this work. two possibilities for tailoring in combination of application. and media devices in practice are investigated in an explorative between-subject design and hypothesis-generating study (N = 68). First. the effect of a browser-based training without gamification or with assignment of gamification appropriate to mean user characteristic on training duration is investigated. Second. the effect of this training and a subsequent serious game app on perception and possible combinations of different media is investigated. The results of behavior lead to the hypothesis that with tailored gamification in browsers. users may train longer in the middle range of training duration. The results of perception show a significant difference and higher perceived value/usefulness and overall rating. as well as the assumption of a higher effect in computer and mobile training in the group with tailored gamification. This could therefore provide a basis for combinations. A combination of both usage scenarios is perceived by users as most reasonable for a positive training effect. Nevertheless. there is a high variance for self-assessed usage. Thus. the results support developing multiple combinable scenarios. tailored to the user. in media devices and game integration to address intended effects. development and user needs to support the effect of cognitive software training in practice.   2022.

However. existing solutions do not effectively evaluate employees' skills. or they do only partially. neither provide mechanisms to describe subjects' skills and desiderata. To face this issue. this paper proposes a decision model for assisting human resource management in effectively evaluating the degree of mutual satisfaction in job-employee assignments. In particular. the decision model has been devised with the following core characteristics: i) employees' skills are modeled by combining hard skills (e.g.: Academic training and competencies) and soft skills (e.g.: socio-relational experiences), ii) employees' soft skills are self-evaluated. giving importance not so much to experiences possessed but rather how such skills have been applied over time, iii) employees and managers can self-evaluate their preferences to enable the achievement of the optimal allocation by maximizing the global mutual satisfaction iv) partial matches between characteristics and desires of both employees and jobs are measured through a set of tailored fuzzy metrics. The proposed decision model has been validated in a real case to support the allocation of newly hired employees among open job positions in a Public Administration. Results showed an adequate ability of the proposed model both to support the description of employees. skills. jobs and preferences. and to suggest the best allocation maximizing the global mutual satisfaction. Summarizing. a decision model for human resource management with innovative characteristics is proposed and used to support decisions for a real allocation problem.   2013 IEEE."
753,Semen analysis is currently performed by using two techniques. Visual assessment technique is manual observation based technique and strongly depends on the experiences of the observer. Therefore. the reliability of the results is skeptical. On the other hand. computer based expert systems are more consistent and reliable. However. they are very expensive systems. therefore. cannot be utilized in many laboratories. In this study. we proposed a hybrid expert system utilizing visual assessment environment with the computerized analyzing part to eliminate the disadvantages of each technique. In the proposed system. smartphone based data acquisition approach is used to provide more modular and practical expert system for the sperm analysis. The records are. then. transferred to the server to analyze by developed software. In this analyzing software. we proposed multi-stage hybrid analyzing approach in terms of video stabilization. sperm concentration and motility analysis. Each video was initially fixed by the Speed Up Robust Features based matching technique. Then. Kalman Filter was employed for sperm tracking. After tracking step. trajectories have been divided into 3 s length to prevent possible incorrect assignments due to sudden changes in sperm motions. In the experimental tests. we combined all trajectories obtained from a total of 18 videos of 6 different subjects. We clustered a total of 89438 trajectories into 4 cluster as fast progressive. progressive. non-progressive and immotile according to extracted seven features. In order to compare the results. we also analyzed the same semen sample in another expert system. SQA-Vision. The difference was measured 3.4% and 4.8% in the determination of total and motile sperm concentration. and 2.1%. 7.4%. 5.3% for progressive. non-progressive and immotile movement type analysis respectively. The significance and impact of the proposed system are capability of reporting more detailed results in a variety of situations and having more advantages than any expert systems utilized for sperm analysis in terms of portability. cost and modularity. Additionally. to the best of our knowledge. this is the first study reporting use of the smartphone in an expert system for the sperm analysis in terms of data acquisition and result reporting.   2021 Elsevier Ltd
754,Teaching via the Web is a new issue that functions mostly as a possible academic infrastructure and a fruitful field of inquiry into its influence on teaching & learning practices. It is a subject that deserves more attention since it is so new. Due to the major differences between e-core learning and face-to-face transmission. extra new abilities for programmed development. online evaluation. and interaction. in addition to conventional characteristics. are needed in contrast to conventional features. Construct online programs and websites from the ground up using MOODLE. a package of the program that allows you to do just that. It is called a Learning Management System (LMS) because it allows students. instructors. and peers to work together more efficiently on initiatives or assignments in general. In this paper. we will look at how instructors utilize MOODLE to build exciting and exciting learning programs at a variety of specialized schools. as well as how educators make use of the multiple capabilities of MOODLE to develop vivid and fascinating teaching circumstances.   2022.

755,Background: One of the main responsibilities of the parents is training toddlers how to control urination. Developmentally Appropriate (DAP) Practice is a useful method of toilet training for children. Video modeling is an important tool for teaching new motor skills to both children and adults. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of Toddlers? Daily Toilet Training (TDTT) based on DAP on duration of toilet training in toddlers. Methods: This quasi-experimental field trial was conducted in healthcare centers of Isfahan. Iran. in 2018-2019. Overall. 130 pair of mothers and their 18-24 months old infants were recruited using multi-stage sampling. The subjects were then divided into a control (n=75) and an intervention (n=55) group by random assignment. At the beginning of the DAP-based approach. the subjects were assessed every 2-4 weeks in terms of readiness for toilet training by using the Child and Mother Readiness Assessment Checklist. After achieving 80% score in the checklist. the mothers in the intervention group participated in TDTT program. while the control group received no intervention. For both groups. another checklist was completed every two weeks to determine toilet training duration and time to achieve urination control. Data analysis was carried out in SPSS18 software using the independent t-tests. Chi-square test. and Mann-Whitney test at significance level of 0.05. Results: The mean duration of daily urination control in the control group (43.6 22.58 days) was significantly longer than in the TDTT group (28.71 12.12 days) (P=0.02). The age of readiness in both group ranged from 21 to 27 months. The duration of urination control was significantly associated with the mother's level of education (P=0.04) but inversely related to the age of achieving readiness (P=0.03) and the mother's employment status (P=0.05). Conclusion: Based on the results. the TDTT program using video modeling and the DAP approach is effective in shortening the duration of toilet training in toddlers.   2022.

756,This paper intends to describe an educational experiment accomplished in the Geometry and Architecture course of the first year in the Faculty of Architecture of the University of Porto in 2017. In this activity. students were introduced to digital three-dimensional modelling as an additional tool to develop their knowledge of geometry. The subject of solid tessellations was selected as leitmotif because of the structural and architectonic interest and creative potential that the situations in which polyhedra. other than the cuboid. fill space may have for aspiring architects. The time limitations of the academic year impaired the desired breadth for the task. so students had to focus their attention only in six uniform solid tessellations. out of the possible 28. Besides acquiring digital design modelling skills useful for their scholarly and professional practice. this experiment and collaborative assignment allowed students to improve knowledge of polyhedral theory and apply newfound IT skills in architectural design.   2022.

757,Objective ? To examine the role of academic librarians in online courses in a university setting. Design ? Survey questionnaire. Setting ? A multi-campus university in the southern United States. Subjects ? Students. faculty. and librarians who had taken. taught. or assisted in fully online courses. Methods ? Email addresses for potential survey participants were provided by the university office of institutional research. The researchers tailored survey questions weto specific subject groups. The surveys took roughly 15 minutes to complete and were open for 1 week following the original email. Surveys included 12 ? 16 questions. depending on the version. and included questions relating to the use of librarians in online courses. the type of assistance they provided. and how assistance was provided (e.g.. in person. email. live chat). Question types included yes/no. check-all-that-apply. and open-ended-answer. Main Results ? Of the student responders. 23.24% reported asking a librarian for help with research or an assignment. This help included finding resources (34.48%). database searching (28.57%). and searching the library catalog (20.69%). Help was given over email (28.03%). live chat (31.82%). and in person (17.42%). which was reported to be most helpful by several students. Only 10.61% reported using video-conferencing software such as Zoom. Only 5.88% of faculty reported including a librarian for synchronous instruction in online courses. while 19.12% made use of asynchronous tutorials created by a librarian. The majority of respondents (93.1%) had not worked with an embedded librarian in their courses. and many reported not knowing that it was an option. Instead. faculty perceived librarians to be an outside resource. Both faculty members and students reported a desire for more video tutorials from librarians. Several faculty mentioned wanting a library module that could serve as an introduction to the library. library resources. and basic instruction topics such as citation styles. Conclusion ? While some students and faculty have worked with librarians in online courses and welcomed their involvement. there is room for improvement in library outreach. including how the library communicates with and supports this growing population.   2022.

758,BACKGROUND The gut microbiota (GM) has been proven to play a role in the regulation of host lipid metabolism. which provides a new theory about the pathogenesis of dyslipidemia. However. the associations of GM with dyslipidemia based on sex differences remain unclear and warrant elucidation. AIM To investigate the associations of GM features with serum lipid profiles based on sex differences in a Chinese population. METHODS This study ultimately recruited 142 participants (73 females and 69 males) at Honghui Hospital. Xi'an Jiaotong University. The anthropometric and blood metabolic parameters of all participants were measured. According to their serum lipid levels. female and male participants were classified into a high triglyceride (H_TG) group. a high total cholesterol (H_CHO) group. a low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (L_HDL-C) group. and a control (CON) group with normal serum lipid levels. Fresh fecal samples were collected for 16S rRNA gene sequencing. UPARSE software. QIIME software. the RDP classifier and the FAPROTAX database were used for sequencing analyses. RESULTS The GM composition at the phylum level included Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes as the core GM. Different GM features were identified between females and males. and the associations between GM and serum lipid profiles were different in females and males. The GM features in different dyslipidemia subgroups changed in both female patients and male patients. Proteobacteria. Lactobacillaceae. Lactobacillus and Lactobacillus_salivarius were enriched in H_CHO females compared with CON females. while Coriobacteriia were enriched in L_HDL-C females. In the comparison among the three dyslipidemia subgroups in females. Lactobacillus_salivarius were enriched in H_CHO females. and Prevotellaceae were enriched in L_HDL-C females. Compared with CON or H_TG males. Prevotellaceae. unidentified_Ruminococcaceae. Roseburia and Roseburia_inulinivorans were decreased in L_HDL-C males (P value < 0.05). and linear discriminant analysis effect size analysis indicated an enrichment of the above GM taxa in H_TG males compared with other male subgroups. Additionally. Roseburia_inulinivorans abundance was positively correlated with serum TG and total cholesterol levels. and Roseburia were positively correlated with serum TG level. Furthermore. Proteobacteria (0.724. 95%CI: 0.567-0.849). Lactobacillaceae (0.703. 95%CI: 0.544-0.832). Lactobacillus (0.705. 95%CI: 0.547-0.834) and Lactobacillus_salivarius (0.706. 95%CI: 0.548-0.835) could distinguish H_CHO females from CON females. while Coriobacteriia (0.710. 95%CI: 0.547-0.841). Coriobacteriales (0.710. 95%CI: 0.547- 0.841). Prevotellaceae (0.697. 95%CI: 0.534-0.830). Roseburia (0.697. 95%CI: 0.534-0.830) and Roseburia_inulinivorans (0.684. 95%CI: 0.520-0.820) could discriminate H_TG males from CON males. Based on the predictions of GM metabolic capabilities with the FAPROTAX database. a total of 51 functional assignments were obtained in females. while 38 were obtained in males. This functional prediction suggested that cellulolysis increased in L_HDL-C females compared with CON females. but decreased in L_HDL-C males compared with CON males. CONCLUSION This study indicates associations of GM with serum lipid profiles. supporting the notion that GM dysbiosis may participate in the pathogenesis of dyslipidemia. and sex differences should be considered.

760,Background: The unique feature of the Internet is that individual negative attitudes toward minoritized and racialized groups and more extreme. hateful ideologies can find their way onto specific platforms and instantly connect people sharing similar prejudices. The enormous frequency of hate speech/cyberhate within online environments creates a sense of normalcy about hatred and the potential for acts of intergroup violence or political radicalization. While there is some evidence of effective interventions to counter hate speech through television. radio. youth conferences. and text messaging campaigns. interventions for online hate speech have only recently emerged. Objectives: This review aimed to assess the effects of online interventions to reduce online hate speech/cyberhate. Search Methods: We systematically searched 2 database aggregators. 36 individual databases. 6 individual journals. and 34 websites. as well as bibliographies of published reviews of related literature. and scrutiny of annotated bibliographies of related literature. Inclusion Criteria: We included randomized and rigorous quasi-experimental studies of online hate speech/cyberhate interventions that measured the creation and/or consumption of hateful content online and included a control group. Eligible populations included youth (10?17 years) and adult (18+ years) participants of any racial/ethnic background. religious affiliation. gender identity. sexual orientation. nationality. or citizenship status. Data Collection and Analysis: The systematic search covered January 1. 1990 to December 31. 2020. with searches conducted between August 19. 2020 and December 31. 2020. and supplementary searches undertaken between March 17 and 24. 2022. We coded characteristics of the intervention. sample. outcomes. and research methods. We extracted quantitative findings in the form of a standardized mean difference effect size. We computed a meta-analysis on two independent effect sizes. Main Results: Two studies were included in the meta-analysis. one of which had three treatment arms. For the purposes of the meta-analysis we chose the treatment arm from the  lvarez-Benjumea and Winter (2018) study that most closely aligned with the treatment condition in the Bodine-Baron et al. (2020) study. However. we also present additional single effect sizes for the other treatment arms from the  lvarez-Benjumea and Winter (2018) study. Both studies evaluated the effectiveness of an online intervention for reducing online hate speech/cyberhate. The Bodine-Baron et al. (2020) study had a sample size of 1570 subjects. while the  lvarez-Benjumea and Winter (2018) study had a sample size of 1469 tweets (nested in 180 subjects). The mean effect was small (g = ?0.134. 95% confidence interval [?0.321. ?0.054]). Each study was assessed for risk of bias on the following domains: randomization process. deviations from intended interventions. missing outcome data. measurement of the outcome. and selection of the reported results. Both studies were rated as ?low risk? on the randomization process. deviations from intended interventions. and measurement of the outcome domains. We assessed the Bodine-Baron et al. (2020) study as ?some? risk of bias regarding missing outcome data and ?high risk? for selective outcome reporting bias. The  lvarez-Benjumea and Winter (2018) study was rated as ?some concern? for the selective outcome reporting bias domain. Authors' Conclusions: The evidence is insufficient to determine the effectiveness of online hate speech/cyberhate interventions for reducing the creation and/or consumption of hateful content online. Gaps in the evaluation literature include the lack of experimental (random assignment) and quasi-experimental evaluations of online hate speech/cyberhate interventions. addressing the creation and/or consumption of hate speech as opposed to the accuracy of detection/classification software. and assessing heterogeneity among subjects by including
761,Distributed systems programming (DSP) is an important subject in the Computer Engineering undergraduate degree. The use of a version of the SIMCAM simulator adapted to the educational context enabled our DSP students to exercise important facets of DSP that are otherwise difficult or impossible to incorporate in student activities. Analyzing and quantifying the assumed benefits of this educational intervention on student learning enables us to better adapt such interventions to student needs. To investigate the impact on student learning of this novel use of a simulator we analyze both the course-assessment results and the constructors of the technology acceptance model. the latter via an initial survey of student perceptions carried out at the beginning of the course and another carried out after completing the simulator-based assignment. We observe. in particular. an improvement in the overall grades between the target year and those of the year previous to the simulator introduction. Moreover. other statistical findings are also of interest.   2019 Wiley Periodicals. Inc.
762,Universities and are increasingly recognizing their responsibility to guide students and graduates in their career development. The need to understand how the learning environment affects the acquisition of such general knowledge or competencies. and of subject-specific knowledge and competencies. as well as the contribution of the learning environment to the development and strengthening of career competencies for effective career management of the target group of students is a topical research problem of many studies. At the national scale. no study has yet been conducted to examine the contribution of the higher education learning environment to the development of students? career competencies. The main purpose of the paper is to create an overview of elements of the learning environment and its contribution to the development of students? career competencies with the help of the theoretical starting points of domestic and foreign scientific and professional literature in the field of career development. pedagogy and related fields. We identified which factors of the learning environment are most often highlighted as important for strengthening students? career competencies.   2021. Pedagoska Obzorja d.o.o. All rights reserved.
763,In this paper. downlink joint codebook assignment. user association. and power allocation for a sparse code Multiple access (SCMA)-based systems in cloud radio access network (C-RAN) are considered. The principal point of this paper is to achieve a resource allocation to accomplish the minimum total system transmit power subject to SCMA restriction. total available power in radio remote head (RRH). fronthual limitation. and quality of service (QoS) prerequisites for each user with low complexity algorithm. To solve the recommended optimization problem an iterative algorithm considering successive convex approximation (SCA) is utilized. Subsequently. the main problem is separated into two subproblems of joint codebook assignment and user association and power allocation. By intelligently defining user association constraint. subproblem of the joint codebook assignment and user association is converted to integer Linear programming (ILP) and solved with available online software such as CVX. Also. to solve the power allocation subproblem successive convex approximation with low complexity (SCALE) is used. Furthermore in this paper we study the effect of the channel state information (CSI) estimation on system model performance. In the simulation results. the adequacy of the recommended solution to minimize total system transmit power is shown and compared to the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and the orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) in C-RAN.   2022.

764,Release is a ubiquitous concept in software development. referring to grouping multiple independent changes into a deliverable piece of software. Mining releases can help developers understand the software evolution at coarse grain. identify which features were delivered or bugs were fixed. and pinpoint who contributed on a given release. A typical initial step of release mining consists of identifying which commits compose a given release. We could find two main strategies used in the literature to perform this task: time-based and range-based. Some release mining works recognize that those strategies are subject to misclassifications but do not quantify the impact of such a threat. This paper analyzed 13.419 releases and 1.414.997 commits from 100 relevant open-source projects hosted at GitHub to assess both strategies in terms of precision and recall. We observed that. in general. the range-based strategy has superior results than the time-based strategy. Nevertheless. even when the range-based strategy is in place. some releases still show misclassifications. Thus. our paper also discusses some situations in which each strategy degrades. potentially leading to bias on the mining results if not adequately known and avoided.   2022.

765,Simulations were used in lecture-based courses. Thermodynamics I and Thermodynamics II. for demonstration purposes and as digital assignments. Digital assignments were separate from the customary pencil & paper homework given once a week. The primary objective was to model the flow and heat transfer in a system. reinforce theoretical concepts. and allow study of more complex two- and three-dimensional problems. Students encounter fluid flow and heat transfer in the sophomore course. Thermodynamics I. for the first time. Velocity. pressure and temperature fields are quite complicated even for simple geometries. hard to visualize. and difficult to understand. Digital assignments go beyond basic theoretical concepts and relatively simple pencil & paper problems. Initially. there were 6 digital assignments in each course. After the first offerings and assessments. the number of assignments is expected to grow to 8-10. Scaffolding of digital assignments ensured that simulations gain in complexity as students become more familiar with both the theoretical underpinnings and the software interface. Our Mechanical Engineering program. has a freshmen graphic communication course incorporating AutoCAD and a junior CAD course with SolidWorks and Ansys. This provided both a challenge and an opportunity for lecture-based thermofluids courses positioned in between. Modern computational skills were obtained outside the classroom. and that was accomplished with effective use of an on-line environment. Ansys Fluent was chosen to present and reinforce thermo-fluids fundamentals. Each digital assignment had a mesh. detailed grading criteria. and supplementary documentation. Students worked on the: (1) problem set up in the preprocessor-stage. (2) solver. and (3) postprocessor. This approach helped students (1) understand the flow and heat transfer inside the system as well 1 Contact author: milanovic@hartford.edu as the application of conservation of mass and energy. (2) understand and interpret results by comparing them with theoretical and experimental data. (3) develop modern technical skills relevant to the demands of Industry 4.0. and (4) develop research capabilities. Simulations in the classroom and as digital assignments are a representation of the real world. and provide an egalitarian and unrestricted way for students to interact with it. acquiring skills and an appreciation for subject matter as well as the engineering profession. Semester long discussions on various aspects of digital assignments help develop a mentor-mentee bond. This approach to teaching. research and mentoring does not depend on access to laboratory facilities and funding that can reach only a limited number of students. It encourages students spirit of inquiry. and ultimately leads to a professional development opportunities beyond the classroom setting.   2021 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

766,A distributed control plane is more scalable and robust in software defined networking. This paper focuses on controller load balancing using packet-in request redirection. that is. given the instantaneous state of the system. determining whether to redirect packet-in requests for each switch. such that the overall control plane response time (CPRT) is minimized. To address the above problem. we propose a framework based on Lyapunov optimization. First. we use the drift-plus-penalty algorithm to combine CPRT minimization problem with controller capacity constraints. and further derive a non-linear program. whose optimal solution is obtained with brute force using standard linearization techniques. Second. we present a greedy strategy to efficiently obtain a solution with a bounded approximation ratio. Third. we reformulate the program as a problem of maximizing a non-monotone submodular function subject to matroid constraints. We implement a controller prototype for packet-in request redirection. and conduct trace-driven simulations to validate our theoretical results. The results show that our algorithms can reduce the average CPRT by 81.6% compared to static assignment. and achieve a 3? improvement in maximum controller capacity violation ratio.   2022 Elsevier B.V.
767,This study examined teachers' difficulties that they encountered free semester science assessment and their problem solutions. Fifteen science teachers who had experiences of free semester teaching and assessment were selected by convenience sampling in this study. The participant teachers mentioned difficulties of accurate scoring in student self/peer assessment and suggested solutions of providing studetns with detailed assessment criteria and opportunities to practice assessment. The participant teachers mentioned a lack of objective assessment criteria for affective domain and suggested solutions of providing criteria prior to assessment and developing assessment framework. The participant teachers mentioned a lack of assessment tools and references for perforamnce assesement. The participant teachers mentioned difficulties of a large teacher-student ratio for providng feedbacks to students and suggested solutions of decreasing teacher-student ratio and teaching load. The participant teachers mentioned difficulties of identifying student characteristics for assessment reporting and suggested solutions of decreaing teacher work load. The participant teachers mentioned a lack of teacher understanding of process based assessment and inactive attitude to performance assessment and suggested solutions of professional learning community and improving teacher perceptions on performance assessment. The participant teachers mentioned difficulties of a large teacher-student ratio and a lack of time for implementing assessment methods that they learned from professional development programs. With both teacher self-efforts and systematic support. these problems would be solved and success of free semester assessment would be achieved.

768,Using in-depth interviews. we asked sexuality educators in South Africa about their own professional preparation and what they believed were necessary educator characteristics for teaching Sexuality Education. Our findings show that our teachers taught Sexuality Education without any appropriate qualification or preparation. but because they had a lighter teaching load and had room to take on more teaching hours. Nevertheless. they all mention that 'not anybody can teach Sexuality Education'. Drawing on Shulman's taxonomy of knowledge and Freire's concept of critical consciousness. we attempt to make meaning of the teachers' responses and their relevance for the teaching of Sexuality Education.

This paper proposes an educational application called Questionify that implements the gamification elements and allow users to collect points. gain achievements. increase motivation and engagement towards students' coursework in Software Engineering subject. Questionify is developed using C# and Java language has been evaluated using questionnaire among 24 respondents. The findings showed that the respondents believe that gamification can do better in education as compare to the traditional method of teaching the students. In the future. this gamification approach will be tested on more technical subjects such as programming and networking subjects to help students engage in a different learning approach.

Practice shows that the current system is well adapted to the pace of development of college management informationization. and improves college management decision-making ability and level.   2021 ACM.
779,The Teacher Assignment Problem is part of the University Timetabling Problem and involves assigning teachers to courses. taking their preferences into consideration. This is a complex problem. usually solved by means of heuristic algorithms. In this paper a Mixed Integer Linear Programing model is developed to balance teachers' teaching load (first optimization criterion). while maximizing teachers' preferences for courses according to their category (second optimization criterion). The model is used to solve the teachers-courses assignment in the Department of Management at the School of Industrial Engineering of Barcelona. in the Universitat Polit{\`{e}}cnica de Catalunya. Results are discussed regarding the importance given to the optimization criteria. Moreover. to test the model's performance a computational experiment is carried out using randomly generated instances based on real patterns. Results show that the model is proven to be suitable for many situations (number of teachers-courses and weight of the criteria). being useful for departments with similar requests.
780,In this paper. we develop mixed-integer linear programming models for assigning the most appropriate teaching assistants to the tutorials in a department. The objective is to maximize the number of tutorials that are taught by the most suitable teaching assistants. accounting for the fact that different teaching assistants have different capabilities and each teaching assistant's teaching load cannot exceed a maximum value. Moreover. with optimization models. the teaching load allocation. a time-consuming process. does not need to be carried out in a manual manner. We have further presented a number of extensions that capture more practical considerations. Extensive numerical experiments show that the optimization models can be solved by an off-the-shelf solver and used by departments in universities.

781,"Objective: To ascertain the teaching load of general practices. the capacity for expansion of general practice-based teaching and the support required to achieve this.Design. setting and participants: Questionnaire-based survey of general practitioners and practices who were teaching medical students. junior doctors or GP registrars in partnership with the Adelaide to Cutback GP Training Program or the Discipline of General Practice at the University of Adelaide in South Australia in 2007.Main outcome measures: Current teaching load of general practices, GPs' reasons for teaching, capacity of practices to increase teaching loads, and support required to realise practices' full teaching capacity.Results: In 2007. the 76 practices involved in the survey taught. in total. 326 medical students. 39 junior doctors and 84 GP registrars. Exposing students and doctors to general practice was cited most often by the 194 GP respondents as the reason for teaching. Few practices rated the support payments for teaching as adequate or fairly adequate. A number of practices were able to increase their teaching load within their current levels. with most being able to teach more medical students (39{\%} of practices) or registrars (42{\%} of practices). All practices able to increase their teaching load stated that their capacity to expand was conditional on extra resources. including more physical space. subsidies and teachers.Conclusion: Scope exists to increase teaching in the general practices surveyed and is related to the level. or levels. of teaching undertaken by the practices. Targeted support seems essential if practices are to increase their teaching load. MJA 2009, 191: 102-104 PU  - AUSTRALASIAN MED PUBL CO LTD PI  - PYRMONT PA  - LEVEL 2. 26-32 PYRMONT BRIDGE RD.

782,Evidence of participants' work-family interface seems consistent with expansionist theory principles (vis-a-vis conflict theory). Using archival data of 270 faculty members. this study sought to illuminate the influence of occupying multiple roles (paid worker. spouse-partner. and parent) and role quality (stress from household responsibilities and satisfaction with job autonomy and independence) on stress from work demands (teaching load. research-publishing. and committee work). Using only childless respondents. marital status and role quality did not predict work stress. Married-partnered workers with children reported less stress from research-publishing demands and committee work than childless married-partnered faculty. Stress from managing household responsibilities was positively related to stress from work demands. and satisfaction with job autonomy and independence was inversely related to stress from teaching load and research-publishing demands. Higher levels of autonomy and independence corresponded with lower levels of work stress even for workers whose jobs permitted relatively high levels of flexibility.

783,Satisfaction with the quality of students. autonomy. faculty support. honorarium. and preference for teaching were significant predictors of adjunct faculty loyalty. With the exception of autonomy. these factors along with a heavy teaching load. collaborative research with full-time faculty. and satisfaction with teaching schedule were predictive of overall job satisfaction. If institutions continue to rely heavily on part-time or adjunct faculty. it is argued that they need to provide more support for part-timers to promote quality educational experiences in the classroom.

785,In recent years. digital learning has been converting from e-learning to m-learning because of the significant growth of wireless and mobile computing technologies. Students can learn any time and any where with mobile devices. Consequently. context-aware ubiquitous learning (u-learning) is emerging as a new research area. It integrates wireless. mobile and context awareness technologies in order to detect the situation of the learners and provide more seamless adaptive support in the learning process. In this paper. a context-aware u-learning environment is developed for learning about campus vegetation in elementary schools based on an innovative approach by employing repertory grid method in designing learning content. In addition. we probe the feasibility of context-aware u-learning in courses by soliciting feedback from the students and teachers through interviews and questionnaires. The findings reveal that the environment is capable of enhancing students' motivation and learning effectiveness. Moreover. it is also capable of reducing the teaching load while enabling better control of class order. PU  - WILEY PI  - HOBOKEN PA  - 111 RIVER ST. HOBOKEN 07030-5774. NJ USA

787,Faculty participation in mentoring undergraduate research can be limited by the time demands involved and the relatively low compensation typically offered at most institutions. The system designed by Chapman University's Office of Undergraduate Research and Creative Activity (OURCA) facilitates independent research by undergraduate students who wish to receive academic credit and awards teaching credit to faculty members who mentor this research. This faculty-student research banking (FSRB) program counts student research credits toward faculty teaching loads. allowing 24 credits to be exchanged for a one-course reduced teaching load in a future academic term. The financial and structural parameters of the FSRB program and data from the first three years of its operation are provided. including guidelines developed and lessons learned. which may assist other institutions in applying and creating similar systems.

788,For nurturing students' sound science view it is essential to teach with integrated science curriculum and instruction material. Korean Science Curriculum has been modified with integrated science subject. It still needs further integration because contents of integration are not enough to accomplish complete science contents integration. Inquiry centered integration would be helpful but there are some weak points because of limited number of appropriate science contents for inquiry centered integration. Science centered integration is needed for many reason. Some of them are as follows: Firstly. Science responds to children's need to learn about the world around them. Secondly student's everyday experience is the foundation for science. For elementary school teachers who should teach many specified subject science centered integration instruction material would lessen teachers' teaching load. The lesson plans which are developed in this study would be help to elementary teachers. PU  - The Korean Society of Biology Education
789,To comply with the European Higher Education Area (EHEA) in Spain. a law was published (RD 1393/2007) which regulates official studies for degrees. masters and doctorates. Several new Pharmacy degrees have been approved by the Ministry for Education according to this law. both in public and private universities. The objective of our work was to analyse these Pharmacy degrees. paying attention to the content of the various modules. as well as to the relative percentage of teaching load within each topic in the curricula according to its nature: basic. obligatory and optional. We can conclude that the degrees of all universities analysed are very homogeneous. particularly in regard to the formative content of the established modules. in accordance to the general guidelines. The greater variation seems to be located in optional subjects as well as in Art and Humanities modules. the latter being quite common in private universities. PU  - UNIV GRANADA.

790,This paper considers the problem of assigning faculty to courses at a university. Traditional operations research methods emphasizing the use of mathematical models suffer several shortcomings. including poor handling of qualitative data. undue abstraction from the problem. difficulty of problem formulation. and the combinatorial problem. This paper presents a knowledge-based system (KBS) approach to the faculty-course assignment problem that is believed to offer advantages over previous mathematical scheduling methods. A variety of criteria such as course preferences by faculty. scheduled course offerings. faculty teaching load and maximum number of days an instructor teaches per week are considered in developing the model. This KBS was applied to a department in a major university. and real-world faculty-course assignment examples were used to illustrate the model's potential. The KBS's recommendations were subsequently validated by the course coordinators. The system demonstrates that KBSs can be an effective tool for faculty-course scheduling.

791,As the pillars of knowledge. universities are required to pursue and expand our understanding of phenomena. This implies that universities should apart from teaching and community involvement be actively engaged in research-related activities. It often happens that factors such as a heavy teaching load and a lack of focus affects the amount of time spend on research-related activities. It is therefore necessary that research should be a purpose-driven process that should be considered at both strategic and departmental level. By using organisational culture literature. specific the three-level typology of Schein (1992). this article aims to identify values that should be incorporated into the culture of both faculties and the wider university to aid the development of a research culture. Values are tangible and are therefore a measurable part of organisational culture. If the proposed values are incorporated a sustained research culture could be created.

792,Though related to a specific concept in transition. the theme of this article is part of a more global reflection on inclusive education. With special education teachers and students being reintegrated into the regular classroom. the concept of coeducation has been in the spotlight in recent years. The objective of this article is to put the effectiveness and framework conditions of coeducation in perspective and to bring out the research perspectives needed to support or refute current guidelines for the implementation of inclusive coeducation. We will first position the problem in the Swiss context. and then define the key concepts of co-education in relation to the intensity of methods of sharing the teaching load. We will then present the results of several related studies on the effectiveness of coeducation in terms of school results and student behaviour. along with the benefits perceived by the students and teachers. We will then show the framework conditions recommended by different authors for putting coeducation in place in the classroom.

793,"Our institution is currently investing in the process-oriented methods of integrative learning to prepare students for a world that is not partitioned along disciplinary boundaries. Our departmental contribution to this investment is an initiative called ""Educating the Educator"" where we teach computational processes and computational thinking to colleagues from non-computational fields. Specifically. we designed a system where non-computational faculty members (along with undergraduates) enroll in an introductory. multidisciplinary. open source Geographic Information System (GIS) course to experience integrative learning as students. The faculty participants are subsequently required to integrate their newly acquired expertise with their own disciplinary teaching and research, the necessary time commitment is compensated by a three-credit teaching load reallocation. Our hypothesis is that increasing the general faculty's appreciation of computation (in the context of integrative learning) is an indirect yet effective and scalable way to reach a wider group of students to convey our fundamental disciplinary message: computing is more than programming and computing empowers people.

794,The mastery of English is currently considered inescapable to achieve the internationalization of students and improve their work expectations. This study analyzes the perspective of university professors in Experimental Sciences regarding the employment of English as a medium of instruction (EMI) in the classroom in order to facilitate its implementation in this field. The results were obtained through an online survey. Teaching load reduction. training provision and economic incentives are the aids most valued by the academic staff for teaching in English. The main difficulties encountered by the academics using EMI in the classroom are related to the low level of English of the students and. to a lesser extent. to their own lack of command of this language. The results obtained show the importance of the available services in the Universidad de Alicante (UA) and Universidad Miguel Hernandez (UMH) for the revision/translation of teaching material.

798,A common component of teacher preparation reform includes the development of partner schools. As more universities create partnerships. the impact on faculty rewards. rank and status are significant concerns. This research examined these issues with National Network for Educational Renewal (NNER) institutions. The amount and nature of faculty work in partner schools varied considerably across NNER institutions suggesting that progress is variable and/or that institutions are arriving at different solutions regarding partnerships. In addition. the provision of formal and systematized teaching load credit or course release for faculty who work in partner schools is only slowly emerging at some institutions. Finally. only a small percentage of institutions reported changes in tenure and promotion guidelines recognizing partner school work. with about one third indicating that such changes were under discussion. while half reported no changes.

799,Relative value units exist for measuring clinical productivity. Limited objective measures exist. however. for nonclinical activities. specifically teaching. Objective: To develop an objective measure of teaching productivity linked to a performance-based incentive plan. Methods: Teaching goals and objectives were identified before the 1998-1999 academic year. Teaching value units (TVUs). objective measures for quantifying teaching activities. were developed and assigned based on an estimation of time needed to complete each activity and weighted for importance to the teaching mission. Each physician was allocated teaching time based on past performance and future goals. Targeted TVUs necessary to meet expectations were proportionate to allocated teaching time. Teaching productivity was defined as a percentage of targeted TVUs achieved. Incentive dollars for teaching were distributed based on percentage of targeted TVUs achieved. weighted individually for teaching load. Results: Teaching productivity was evaluated over a three-year period. In year 1. mean TVUs allocated/physician were 181 units (range 25 to 449). Four of 18 physicians (22{\%}) met expectations. The mean individual TV-Us achieved were 54{\%} of expected (range 0{\%} to 114{\%}). By year 3. mean TVUs allocated/physician were 179 (range 45 to 629). Twelve of 22 physicians (55{\%}) met expectations. The mean individual TVUs achieved were 82{\%} of expected (range 11{\%} to 146{\%}). Between year 1 and year 3. group productivity increased from 73{\%} to 88{\%}. and mean individual productivity increased from 54{\%} to 82{\%} (p=0.01). Conclusions: The development of a TVU-based system enabled objective quantification and monitoring of a broad range of teaching activities.

800,In recent years. developing useful learning assistance systems has become a hot research topic in the literature. The learner can be benefited by the useful guidance provided by the learning assistance tool. An effective learning assistance tool can reduce the teaching load of the teacher. However. it is rarely seen that a learning assistance tool employs machine learning techniques to provide appropriate diagnosis or feedback to learners or teachers in the literature. We thus propose a learning assistance tool that employs reinforcement learning technique to continuously interact with the environment in order to offer learners suitable and timely feedback. guide them through the difficulties. Our experimental results reveal that our learning assistance tool can effectively enhance the learners' ICT application ability and assist the learners in overcoming difficulties.

It had been conducted through 70 teachers who are in charge of educating the scientifically gifted. After looking into the conception of gifted students from the teachers' point of view. and class preparation. problems and improvement suggestions. it was found out that science teachers focused more on national competitiveness and tended to regard students with task commitment as gifted. but math teachers focused more on self-actualizations and tended to regard students with creativity as gifted. Most of the teachers spent four times more to prepare classes for the gifted students than those of teachers who teach average students. Also. the research showed that the teachers were suffering from preparing creative learning material and programs. representing the needs to give more assistance such as reduction of teaching load.

804,Possible differences in teaching approaches to university teaching at the disciplines address that faculty members' conceptions of teaching should be explored within specific disciplines in order to develop institutional opportunities for improving teaching and learning [1]. Young faculty members' conceptions are important in order to understand how these conceptions are formed and how they could be targeted in faculty training programs for improving university teaching. Therefore. this study explored the young engineering faculty members' conceptions of teaching. Six young engineering faculty members (three female and three male) were interviewed about their views regarding teaching in their fields. departments' trends about teaching. and university context in general. Specifically. the influence of the nature of the knowledge they taught. the institutional contexts. previous experiences and the other responsibilities they had for their jobs on their teaching conceptions were explored. Findings revealed that young engineering faculty had already established teaching conceptions based on their previous experiences and the difficulties they had during their undergraduate education. Faculty members whom they addressed as effective teachers had a considerable influence on their teaching conceptions. Their conceptions were influenced by the nature of the knowledge they taught as they focused on explaining the major concepts. clarifying the important points. and placing the concepts within an application context. They were not allowed to decide on the teaching content and assessment practices in crowded departments where courses were taught in teams. Yet. they struggled with preparing assessment tasks and were not sure in their effectiveness. Elements of effective classes included faculty member's and students' interest on the concepts. focus on fundamental issues and mistakes. applications. and student participation. Findings addressed that the pressure of research requirements for tenure and the teaching load might be limiting them in managing their efforts and resources in planning for teaching and developing new conceptions.

Utilizing leased university information. we gauged professors' research performance at the department  level and explored how characteristics of departments and universities and student concentration in a certain field affect the research performance. From our regression analysis. we conclude as follows:Firstly. the number of Ph.D students play a decisive positive role in research performance. Secondly. the number of master students do not help that performance. Thirdly. the department faculty size also affects positively. showing the economy of scale. Fourthly. long teaching load has a negative effect on research activity. Fifthly. student concentration ratio has only a very limited positive effect.These results indicate that research centered doctoral program at the department level with a large size of doctoral students and faculty is a possible specialization.

806,Innovative solutions are called for to deal with the increasingly heavy burdens placed on teaching staff in German universities by even higher numbers of student enrolments. Alongside differentiating between research and teaching tenures. as recommended by the German Council of Science and Humanities (Wissenschaftsrat). there is also a series of other options for meeting the challenges. One of these which has proven its value is partial outsourcing of the teaching load to external academic staff provided by a specialised service provider. Such a professionalised approach to teaching leads to a high degree of unity between research and teaching activities. whilst the wide scope for research activities allows to stop the drift of university staff engaged in research into pure institutes of research. meaning that they continue to contribute their expertise to ensure high standards in university teaching.

This research examined these issues with National Network for Educational Renewal (NNER) institutions. The amount and nature of faculty work in partner schools varied considerably across NNER institutions suggesting that progress is variable and/or that institutions are arriving at different solutions regarding partnerships. In addition. the provision of formal and systematized teaching load credit or course release for faculty who work in partner schools is only slowly emerging at some institutions. Finally. only a small percentage of institutions reported changes in tenure and promotion guidelines recognizing partner school work. with about one third indicating that such changes were under discussion. while half reported no changes. Reasons for these findings are offered and analyzed in terms of changing teacher preparation programs. PU  - AMER ASSOC COLL TEACH EDUC PI  - WASHINGTON PA  - SUITE 610. ONE DUPONT CIRCLE.

810,The most important issue concerning with the education and teaching reform is the issue of people. Teachers' working state can directly influence their teaching effects. In resent years. however. teachers are facing with more and more pressures from work or other matters. which result in the working fatigue. declining teaching effect. sub-health. or even other problems like life overdraft or death at young age. Conditions of teachers' pressure are directly related with the school's cultivation objective. educational teaching quality and students' abilities. The paper has conducted researches on teachers' current teaching load. and analyzed elements resulting in pressures and the influence of teachers' pressures on their teaching effect. The paper has proposed management methods and means to release college teachers' pressures and improve the teaching effects from three angles.

816,The excitation energy transfer (ET) pathway and mechanism from an organic antenna to a lanthanide ion has been the subject of discussion for many decades. In the case of europium (Eu3+). it has been suggested that the transfer originates from the ligand singlet state or a triplet state. Taking the lanthanide complex Eu(TTA)3(H2O)2as an example. we have investigated the spectra and luminescence kinetics. mainly at room temperature and 77 K. to acquire the necessary experimental data. We put forward an experimental and theoretical approach to measure the energy transfer rates from the antenna to different Eu3+levels using the Dexter formulation. We find that transfer from the ligand singlet state to Eu3+may account for the ET pathway. by combined electric dipole-electric dipole (ED-ED) and ED-electric quadrupole (EQ) mechanisms. The contributions from the triplet state by these mechanisms are very small. An independent systems rate equation approach can effectively model the experimental kinetics results. The model utilizes the cooperative processes that take place on the metal ion and ligand and considers S0. S1. and T1ligand states in addition to 7F0.15D05D1. and 5DJ (=5L65D35D2combined) Eu3+states. The triplet exchange ET rate is estimated to be of the order 107s-1. The observation of a nanosecond risetime for the Eu3+ 5D1level does not enable the assignment of the ET route or the mechanism. Furthermore. the 5D1risetime may be contributed by several processes. Observation of its temperature dependence and also that of the ground-state population can supply useful information concerning the mechanism because the change in metal-ion internal conversion rate has a greater effect than changes in singlet or triplet nonradiative rates. A critical comparison is included for the model of Malta employed in the online software LUMPAC and JOYSpectra. The theoretical treatment of the exchange mechanism and its contribution are now being considered.   2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.

818,The purpose of the research was to learn more about the current status of science gifted education and to find ways to improve it. It had been conducted through 70 teachers who are in charge of educating the scientifically gifted. After looking into the conception of gifted students from the teachers' point of view. and class preparation. problems and improvement suggestions. it was found out that science teachers focused more on national competitiveness and tended to regard students with task commitment as gifted. but math teachers focused more on self-actualizations and tended to regard students with creativity as gifted. Most of the teachers spent four times more to prepare classes for the gifted students than those of teachers who teach average students. Also. the research showed that the teachers were suffering from preparing creative learning material and programs. representing the needs to give more assistance such as reduction of teaching load. Furthermore. the ideas such as improving the awareness of school administrators. dispatching teachers with full charge. and expansion of training programs had been suggested.

820,In the modern and digital society. the importance of software development is undeniable. Therefore. educating the next generation of software developers is crucial. However. learning how to program is challenging. and research on improving programming pedagogy is essential. Adding a laboratory component to programming courses can enhance the education. In this work. we first elicited requirements and guidelines for an introductory programming lab curriculum based on a literature review and feedback by instructors with years of experience. These included the use of (1) current and adequate tools. (2) collaborative learning environment. (3) formative assessment. (4) appropriate assignments for the target audience. (5) pedagogical innovations. and (6) to prepare students to be lifelong learners of the subject. Following. we present a curriculum for an introductory undergraduate programming lab based on the Raspberry Pi platform. It teaches students how to program following software development best practices and integrate software and hardware through a series of cyber-physical assignments. including developing a rover vehicle. We successfully piloted the curriculum with 30 students. and we present the highly positive feedback provided by them. Although the course was based on the C programming language. the underlying foundation on programming principles will allow students to apply the concepts in any language. Furthermore. this curriculum is not intended to be a one-size-fits-all approach to programming education. However. it can be a strong starting point for readers to tailor it to fit their audience. school needs. and student learning outcomes.

Utilizing leased university information. we gauged professors' research performance at the department  level and explored how characteristics of departments and universities and student concentration in a certain field affect the research performance. From our regression analysis. we conclude as follows:Firstly. the number of Ph.D students play a decisive positive role in research performance. Secondly. the number of master students do not help that performance. Thirdly. the department faculty size also affects positively. showing the economy of scale. Fourthly. long teaching load has a negative effect on research activity. Fifthly. student concentration ratio has only a very limited positive effect.These results indicate that research centered doctoral program at the department level with a large size of doctoral students and faculty is a possible specialization.

830,"Developed in Northern Ontario. Canada. Integrated Clinical Learning (ICL) involves a team of clinical teachers from a range of health professions teaching a team of students and trainees together in common community and clinical settings. It is the balanced integration of educational strategies to develop healthcare providers and team-based competencies focused on improving the quality of care. Learning outcomes are developed with and in consideration of the goals of patients or the community through relational learning that mirrors patient-centred care. Implementing ICL requires a systematic approach that addresses the practical issues and enhances the quality of experience for all involved. These practicalities include academic institutions valuing ICL through the appointment and support of primary care clinicians as academic staff with protected time, the provision of physical space. as well as clinical and teaching equipment, and the appointment of local administrative coordinators. The team approach shares the teaching load with the multiple students actually teaching each other so that the load on individual clinicians is less than for one student at a time. Through ICL. students are learning from patients and developing a service-oriented professional identity. The patient and family centred nature of ICL helps bridge the primary care-secondary care divide as students follow their patients into and out of hospital services. This is positive for patients and specialists and provides authentic learning for students. ICL enhances the quality of care, the quality of learning, and the quality of professional satisfaction for primary care clinical teachers.

831,This study's goal was to examine the relationship between the personal capability beliefs of new elementary-level science teachers in Denmark and their teaching environments for their association with teaching success and science teacher retention. Results suggest that pre-service training can increase the self-efficacy of elementary teachers of science as they enter the profession. In addition. the higher the teacher's assessments of their teaching environments were. the greater the positive changes in their self-efficacy were from pre-service until the end of their first year of teaching. Importantly. there is a positive relationship between these changes in self-efficacy during the first year of teaching and whether teachers continue to teach science. This knowledge may help identify new teachers who are more likely to drop teaching science from their teaching load and therefore enable schools to provide the support needed to ensure the viability and retention of new science teachers.

835,Academic misconduct stemming from file-sharing websites is an increasingly prevalent challenge in tertiary education. including information technology and engineering disciplines. Current plagiarism detection methods (e.g. text matching) are largely ineffective for combatting misconduct in programming and mathematics based assessments. For these reasons. the development of an effective. automated monitoring tool would provide significant benefit in the struggle against misconduct. To address this challenge. this paper reports an innovative software tool named AssignmentWatch which supports academic integrity by actively monitoring for the upload of assessment content online. with a focus on file-sharing websites. This monitoring and alert notification system reduces the time burden on educators by automating the detection process. The design of AssignmentWatch focuses on early detection which enables educators to take early action. This could include preventative education. or removal of content before it is utilized by students. Through this. AssignmentWatch can reduce incidents of misconduct. The software tool is open source and made freely available to the community. AssignmentWatch was validated under controlled conditions. followed by field testing in 30 assignments. across 16 subjects and 5 higher education institutions. AssignmentWatch was found to effectively detect uploads on a variety of websites. generally within 24 hours. In field testing. AssignmentWatch received positive feedback from educators with 8 out of 10 educators stating AssignmentWatch aided academic integrity and 7 out of 10 users stating AssignmentWatch helped identify assignment content online.

838,Introduction Medical student numbers in Britain are increasing rapidly. beyond the capacity of most teaching hospitals. with more clinical teaching taking place in district general hospitals (DGHs). Surveys show that students value the intensive clinical teaching. smaller student numbers and perceived greater friendliness in DGHs. This paper explores DGH staff attitudes to teaching - their level of initial enthusiasm. their attitudes to current teaching. its effect on the hospital and to the sustainability of DGH undergraduate teaching - as both student numbers and service workloads continue to rise.Methods Semi-structured interviews with 6 key informants were used to generate themes for a 19-question pre-piloted anonymous postal questionnaire sent to all 68 staff involved in undergraduate medical teaching in Northampton General Hospital.Results The total response included 85{\%} of consultants. Responses in the 3 staff groups were similar. Most respondents felt enthusiastic at the prospect of medical students. although they realised that this would be intellectually challenging and increase time pressures. These predictions were largely fulfilled. Respondents felt that in comparison to teaching hospitals the DGH teaching was more clinically based and consultant-led. with more approachable staff. Currently 41 respondents (82{\%}) felt that they had inadequate teaching time. A majority felt that the arrival of students had improved patient care and that their department had benefited. Thirty-seven responders (74{\%}) felt that the planned doubling of student numbers would impose an unsustainable departmental load. and would compromise teaching quality. The change felt most necessary to support additional teaching was increased clinical medical staff. Better co-ordination between the DGH and the medical school was also felt necessary. The most popular choice for the distribution of extra teaching finance was to the teacher's directorate. i.e. speciality [33 (66{\%})]. Forty-four (86{\%}) felt that increased student numbers would have a significant impact on the character of the hospital. The 108 free-text comments (2.1 per respondent) centred on hospital character and the benefits of students.Conclusions This study shows a considerable initial enthusiasm for teaching in DGH staff. which is persisting despite increasing student numbers. However. the current teaching load is seen to be substantial. Teaching more students is likely to produce major problems. based on lack of teaching time and increasingly heavy service commitments rather than lack of patients. This is likely to be a widespread problem for DGHs. Failure to ensure adequate teaching staff and facilities as well as co-ordination could threaten the sustainability of this potentially valuable teaching initiative.

The number of academic staff had risen from 41 in 1960 to 143 in 1990 (249{\%} while the publication/staff ratio had fallen from 1.73 in 1960 to 0.48 in 1990 (p {\textless} 0.0001). Student/staff ratios had declined significantly over the 30-year period (p {\textless} 0.005) as had the graduate/staff ratio (p {\textless} 0.01). The Faculty reports indicated that the research-in-progress reported for exceeded the actual publication rate in 1990. whereas the opposite was the case in 1960. There was a statistically significant decline in the number of international conference abstracts published and an increase in the number of regional conference abstracts (p {\textless} 0.01) and also a significant decrease in the number of papers presented at conferences compared with the number of conferences attended without a paper being presented (p {\textless} 0.0001). The research publication record and the medical graduate/staff ratio of the Mona Faculty had declined significantly over the 30 years under review. There was also a significant decline in the graduate/staff ratio in the same period. Some of the conventional reasons given for this decline such as staff shortages and increased clinical service or teaching load are discussed. PU  - UNIV WEST INDIES PI  - KINGSTON PA  - KINGSTON 7.

842,One of the main challenges facing primary mainstream teachers in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) stems from the current educational movement towards inclusion. It is an international phenomenon. a process that emphasizes providing special education services to students with special educational needs within the regular classrooms. The purpose of the study was to identify perceptions about educating students with special educational needs in the mainstream education setting. The researchers examined the issue of inclusive education and the attitudes towards inclusion among the primary mainstream teachers in Dubai in the large private sector. The study was also designed to identify whether these teachers perceived themselves capable of adapting to what inclusion requires.The study relied on qualitative methods. Questionnaires were given to primary mainstream teachers working in two large private schools in Dubai. Additionally teachers were interviewed too. All teachers involved in the study are expatriates. An analysis of data collected indicated that primary mainstream teachers in Dubai in the private sector favour traditional special education service delivery models over full inclusive practices. These teachers felt students with special educational needs lack skills needed to master the mainstream regular classroom course content. The teachers also expressed that the heavy teaching load in the mainstream classroom makes it hard to meet the needs of students with special educational needs in the private sector. However. results also indicated that teachers perceive additional training. support from administrators. and access to related services and resources as necessary in order to meet the needs of their students with special educational needs in the mainstream education setting. The study ended with research based recommendations for future practice. PU  - Sped Sp Zoo PI  - Bielsko-Biala PA  - Legionow 6. Bielsko-Biala. POLAND
843,The paper deals with the issue of detecting plagiarism in source code. which we unfortunately encounter when teaching subjects dealing with programming and software development. Many students want to simplify the completion of the course and therefore submit modified source codes of their classmates or even those found on the Internet. Some try to modify the source code e.g. by changing the identifiers of classes. methods and variables to different ones. by changing the corresponding loops. by introducing new methods or by changing the order of methods in the source code or in other ways. We focused directly on this problem and designed our own anti-plagiarism system that we describe in this paper. The designed system consists of three parts during which the source code is processed using six designed algorithms. The basis is the processing of the source code and its transformation into an abstract syntax tree. consisting of two types of nodes. which is then vectorized using our modified DECKARD algorithm. The vectors are then clustered and stored in a database from which similar parts of the source code can be searched. The output of the system is then the final report containing a list of matches with similarities of all works that have been added to the database until then. The designed anti-plagiarism system is finally compared with the success of plagiarism detection performed by the two most used anti-plagiarism tools. namely JPlag and MOSS. It is evaluated on assignments elaborated by students from the courses dealing with object-oriented programming at our faculty.

844,Sample size determination in multilevel randomized trials (MRTs) and multilevel regression discontinuity designs (MRDDs) can be complicated due to multilevel structure. monetary restrictions. differing marginal costs per treatment and control units. and range restrictions in sample size at one or more levels. These issues have sparked a set of studies under optimal design literature where scholars consider sample size determination as an allocation problem. The literature on optimal design of MRTs and MRDDs and their implementation in software packages has been scarce. scattered. and incomplete. This study unifies optimal design literature and extends currently available software under bound constrained optimal sample allocation (BCOSA) framework via bound constrained optimization technique. The BCOSA framework. introduction to the cosa R library. and an illustration that replicates and extends minimum required sample size determination for an evaluation report is provided.

846,Traditionally. faculty members are evaluated on the three academic areas of teaching. research. and service. The emphasis placed on an area depends on several factors including institutional mission. teaching load requirements. and faculty area of expertise. The explosion of teaching innovations over the last few years makes it increasingly important for faculty members to document their teaching excellence and the impact of their teaching. This article presents 10 domains to document teaching performance for tenure and promotion. or for annual evaluations. PU  - WILEY PI  - HOBOKEN PA  - 111 RIVER ST. HOBOKEN 07030-5774. NJ USA
847,"With the dramatic emergence of the Covid -19 Virus. teachers in schools and universities have been challenged to move from face-to-face to distance learning. This required an update on the materials and the workflow to adapt the teaching approach to the online context and ensure the learning quality. In this work. we will present the adopted approach in a particular course which is procedural programming. a course given for the first-year engineering students of our engineering school. We use two pedagogical approaches for teaching this course: the flipped classroom and the problem-based learning (PBL). The challenge was how to assure team working and provide the same coaching quality, facilitating. problem solving. group management and so on using the same teaching load. Major changes have been made to the current approach. including scripting sessions and teams' coaching. A pedagogical scenario has been developed to enable coaching via video conferences while keeping the active aspect. Students work on their problem situation through collaborative tools and in the virtual presence of their coach. An e-learning platform has been adopted to allow asynchronous interactions. Our reform also affected the length of sessions. assessment and the types of teaching materials used to substitute physical presence in a classroom and the use of a blackboard.

848,While inequalities in scholarly productivity have long existed. the long-term implications on productivity due to the COVID-19 pandemic are not well documented. Using data from a survey of policing scholars. we conduct a mixed-methods analysis to determine the differential impacts of the pandemic on scholarly productivity. focusing on the intersectional effects by gender. childcare responsibilities. academic rank. and teaching load. Findings suggest that the effects of the pandemic were not evenly experienced by criminal justice and criminology researchers with the effects of productivity influenced by gender. rank and childcare responsibilities. We specifically discuss the longer-term implications of the pandemic on academic careers. PU  - ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS. TAYLOR {\&} FRANCIS LTD PI  - ABINGDON PA  - 2-4 PARK SQUARE. MILTON PARK.

850,Introduction. This research carried out a comparative study between three countries severely impacted by the coronavirus based on the analysis of the reflections of teachers and students on university virtual teaching during the confinement stage. Methodology. This descriptive. exploratory and explanatory study applied surveys. between March and April 2020. to students and teachers of Journalism. Communication and Education at the Autonomous University of Barcelona (Spain). University of Turin (Italy). and Technical University of Machala (Ecuador). The survey had responses from 300 students (100 per country) and 196 teachers. Results. The majority of students negatively value the move to virtuality. since it is associated. regularly. with an increase in the teaching load. E-learning has contributed to negatively impacting the view of students on their trainers. while the latter demands basic digital skills in young university students. Discussion. According to the research results. teachers. in the scenario of remote training. must show knowledge not only about the content of the subject but also technological and digital-pedagogical knowledge. Conclusions. The teacher must be able to innovate. reflect and transform their didactic proposals to respond to the social demands that the world is experiencing during a health crisis while achieving the curricular objectives proposed at the beginning of the course. On the other hand. the surveyed teachers recognize that it is necessary to promote critical and reflective thinking linked to the strategic management of ICT.

It enables those decision makers and investors to provide more attention to the aforementioned areas and requirements in order to achieve a competitive advantage. Hence. it contributes to developing national economy.   2020 IEEE.
853,The author proposed a general solution to professor's optimal workload by using Lagrange method. University Management is treated as a utility maximizer. whose objective is to efficiently utilize professor's teaching hours and research output to the maximum level. The paper used the Cob-Douglas utility function for this utility maximization problem. The data used for this analysis were obtained from policy documents of Lira University and Makerere University in Uganda. The model generated varying maximum levels of teaching loads and research output for different categories of academic staff and faculties (Science and Non-science faculties). Generally. workload increases in both dimensions of teaching and research. as remuneration increases when one is promoted from a lower position. say a senior lecturer. to higher position. say Associate professor. The model also generated higher workload both in teaching and research for the Faculty (Sciences) whose academic staff are better paid compared to staff in the nonscience Faculty who are paid lower remunerations. The paper contributes to existing literature on Faculty workload model in two ways: Firstly. is the design of differential maximum workload system for different categories of Academic Staff depending on the level of their remunerations and seniority. Secondly. the decomposition of Academic staff's maximum workload into its teaching and research components for any given fixed amount of remuneration. The paper concludes by suggesting appropriate policy implications.   2020. Center for Promoting Ideas. USA. All Rights Reserved.
